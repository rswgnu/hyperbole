;;
;; Uses the testcover functionality and runs the a specified test
;; suite for a file that is monitored for coverage.  See
;; "testcover.el" for how to interpret the "splotches", the color code
;; characters in the monitored filed.
;;
;; See also "../Makefile#coverage", a make target for running from the
;; command line.

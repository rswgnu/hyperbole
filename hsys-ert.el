;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  ERT is the Emacs Regression Test framework in "ert.el".  Hyperbole uses
;;  it for all of its regression testing as well.
;;
;;  Sometimes when building Emacs Lisp tests with the ERT package, multiple
;;  tests are added to a single test fixture/function.  Each subtest
;;  has its own `should'-type clause.  But if one of these subtests fails,
;;  ERT shows you the test name and the should clause in its results buffer
;;  but if there are 12 subtests, it is difficult to match the displayed
;;  should clause to the source line that ran it.
;;
;;  The `ert-should' implicit button type defined herein solves this problem.
;;  Hyperbole loads this and then a press of the Action Key within an ert
;;  results buffer (or another buffer to which the results have been copied)
;;  produces the following:
;;
;;    - If on the first line of the result with the test name, jump to the
;;      test definition.
;;
;;    - If on a highlighted button, activate the button.
;;
;;    - Otherwise if not at the end of a line and within a failed test result,
;;      find the `should' clause and go to the matching line within the test
;;      source code.  An easy way to use it is to put point at the beginning
;;      of a line other than the first within an ert result and press the
;;      Action Key.

;;; Commentary:
;;
;;   This implements a last-in-first-out stack of traversed locations
;;   for use as a locational history in Hyperbole.  Each location stores
;;   the frame and window locations of all buffers.  When restoring a location,
;;   if new frames are created after the location has been stored, they are
;;   minimized, not deleted.  Use the Emacs Buffer menu to return to them.
;;   Frames which have been deleted are not restored.

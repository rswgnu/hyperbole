;;   `hmouse-install' globally binds the Action and Assist Mouse Keys
;;   to shifted mouse buttons and optionally binds the Action Mouse Key
;;   to the middle mouse button.
;;
;;   `hmouse-toggle-bindings' switches between the Hyperbole mouse
;;   bindings and previous mouse key bindings any time after
;;   `hmouse-install' has been called.

;; This file is part of GNU Hyperbole.

;;; Commentary:
;;
;;  This code is machine independent.  It works best with a pointing device but
;;  may also be used from a keyboard.  When used with a pointing device it
;;  requires an Emacs command that sets point to the location of the pointing
;;  device's cursor.
;;
;;  If you want to use your shift-middle mouse button to select Hyperbole menu
;;  items and Hyperbole buttons, follow these instructions.
;;
;;  If you plan to use a mouse only with the X window system or macOS
;;  and you want to use the shift-middle and shift-right buttons, you
;;  need not do any mouse configuration.  Your Emacs executable must
;;  have been built so as to include the mouse support files for your
;;  window system, however.  These are in the Emacs "src" directory:
;;  for X - "x*.c", for macOS - "ns*.c".
;;
;;  To use a different mouse key or a different window system, modify the
;;  mouse key bindings in "hmouse-sh.el".
;;
;; Using the Action Mouse Key to browse through and delete files from
;; Dired listings is exceptionally nice, just as it is when reading mail.

  2. If on an Org agenda item, jump to the item for editing.

  3. Within a radio or internal target or a link to it, jump between
     the target and the first link to it, allowing two-way navigation.

  4. Follow other internal links in Org mode files.

  5. Follow Org mode external links.

  6. When on a Hyperbole button, activate the button.

  7. With point on the :dir path of a code block definition, display the
     directory given by the path.

  8. With point on any #+BEGIN_SRC, #+END_SRC, #+RESULTS, #+begin_example
     or #+end_example header, execute the code block via the Org mode
     standard binding of {C-c C-c}, (org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c).
  
  9. When point is on an Org mode heading, cycle the view of the subtree
     at point.

  10. In any other context besides the end of a line, invoke the Org mode
      standard binding of {M-RET}, (org-meta-return).

in these contexts:

  1. If on an Org todo keyword, move to the first todo keyword in
     the next set, if any.

  2. If on an Org mode link or agenda item, display Hyperbole
     context-sensitive help.

  3. On a Hyperbole button, perform the Assist Key function, generally
     showing help for the button.

  4. With point on the :dir value of a code block definition, display
     a help summary of this implicit directory button.

  5. With point on any #+BEGIN_SRC, #+END_SRC, #+RESULTS, #+begin_example
     or #+end_example header, remove source block results.

  6. Not on a Hyperbole button but on an Org mode heading, cycle
     through views of the whole buffer outline.

			  What's New in GNU Hyperbole
				 by Bob Weiner

===========================================================================
*                                   V9.0.0
===========================================================================

** HYPERBOLE SYSTEM  (See "(hyperbole)").

  *** Native Compilation Autoloads: Work around Emacs bug where async native
      comp of a package being installed does not load "hyperbole-autoloads.el"
      (require libraries to eliminate all Error-level messages).

  *** Natively Compiled Functions as Action Types: Now may be used as Hyperbole
      button action types.

  *** Large number of byte-compiler warnings eliminated when building the
      Hyperbole package.  None of these warnings should affect use of
      Hyperbole.


** HYROLO  (See "(hyperbole)HyRolo").

  *** Koutline Fast Search: Koutlines may now be included in 'rolo-file-list'
      and individual cells extracted properly with any HyRolo query.  Then
      the interactive commands to show the top-level matches, an outline of
      matches or to show, hide or move to matches all work in the match
      display buffer as well.


** KOUTLINER  (See "(hyperbole)Koutliner").

  *** M-S-left and M-S-Right: Org compatibility - Add tree promote and demote
      commands to these keys (same as existing M-left and M-right keys).


** MENUS  (See "(hyperbole)Menus").

  *** Minibuffer Menu Changes:
        - Multi-line Menus:  When a menu line is too long for the screen,
          it is automatically split into multiple lines and aligned by column
	  for ease of access.

  *** Move Prefix Arg Number of Items: {M-b} and {M-f} move backward and
      forward by the number of items specified in any prefix argument given.


** ORG MODE  (See "(hyperbole)Smart Key - Org Mode").

  *** Todo Cycling: An Action Key press on an Org mode todo state keyword,
      cycles to the next state.  An Assist Key press in the same place 
      cycles to the next set of states, if any.

  *** {C-c /}: Hyperbole {C-c /} web search binding defers to org-mode
      binding, 'org-show-todo-tree' but uses the improved Hyperbole version,
      'hsys-org-todo-occur' which allows filtering to specific todo states.


** SMART (ACTION AND ASSIST) KEYS  (See "(hyperbole)Smart Keys").

  *** Smart Dired: Action Key subdirectory selection at point now works on
      any dired header line, not just the first one.  Use {i} to insert
      multiple subdirectories in Dired mode.

  *** Compilation and Grep Error Lines: Error lines in the Emacs Regression
      Test buffer, *ert*, are now supported, as well as the 'Compiling
      <file>', 'Loading <file>' and 'In <function>' lines as well as source
      line references from Emacs Lisp native compilation within the
      *Async-native-compile-log* buffer.

  *** Path Implicit Buttons: Much improved relative path handling, including
      expanding into executable paths when pathname is prefixed by ! or &,
      handling info paths outside `Info-directory-list', like
      "man/hyperbole.info".


** TEST CASES

  *** Hyperbole Automated Testing: Automated test cases increased to over
      265.  Simply run 'make test-all' or 'make test' from the command-line
      when in the Hyperbole source directory and you should see all tests
      pass.  If any fail, you can press the Action Key to see the source of
      the failure.  Full testing is supported under POSIX systems only.  See
      "Makefile" and "test/MANIFEST".


** WINDOWS GRIDS (See "(hyperbole)grid of windows").

  *** Grid by File Pattern: Fix so prompt for a string pattern rather than
      a file name and force use of full pathnames to avoid improper relative
      path resolution.  See "(hyperbole)hycontrol-windows-grid-by-file-pattern".

===========================================================================
*                                   V8.0.0
===========================================================================


** HYPERBOLE SYSTEM

  *** Installation: Hyperbole package installation options are greatly expanded.
      Stable or in-development branches may be installed with the Emacs package
      manager.  The Straight package manager may be used to keep up with
      git-based development and submit pull requests.  And stable and
      in-development tar balls are available for manual installation.  See
      "(hyperbole)Installation".

  *** Global Minor Mode: Hyperbole is now a global minor mode that can be
      toggled with {M-x hyperbole-mode RET}, meaning all of its key bindings
      can easily be enabled or disabled whenever desired.  Your init file needs
      to have (hyperbole-mode 1) in it instead of (require 'hyperbole) or
      Hyperbole will not be enabled upon startup.  See "(hyperbole)Usage".

      Modeline Indicator: In the modeline where minor modes are shown,
      "Hypb" now appears whenever Hyperbole is active.

      Hooks: When hyperbole-mode is enabled, hyperbole-mode-hook and
      hyperbole-mode-on-hook are run.  When hyperbole-mode is disabled,
      hyperbole-mode-hook and hyperbole-mode-off-hook are run.

      Lexical Binding: All code is now largely lexically bound, improving
      quality and debugability.


** ORG MODE (See "hui-mouse.el#defun smart-org").

  *** M-RET: Reworked M-RET interface so can control how much or little of
      Hyperbole works in Org mode when Hyperbole minor mode is enabled.
      See "(hyperbole)enable org-mode support" and "hsys-org.el".

  *** hsys-org-enable-smart-keys: New customization to replace
      'inhibit-hsys-org'.  This applies only in Org major/minor modes when
      hyperbole-mode is active.  t means enable Smart Key support
      everywhere.  The symbol, buttons, is the default; it means the Smart
      Keys are active only when point is within a Hyperbole button.  A nil
      value means no Smart Key support so {M-RET} behaves just as it does
      normally in Org mode.  See "(hyperbole)Org-mode".  Use {C-h h c o}
      to customize this setting.

      This table summarizes the operation:

      |--------------+-------------------+------------------+----------+------------------|
      | Set To       | Smart Key Context | Hyperbole Button | Org Link | Fallback Command |
      |--------------+-------------------+------------------+----------+------------------|
      | buttons      | Ignore            | Activate         | Activate | org-meta-return  |
      | nil          | Ignore            | Ignore           | Ignore   | org-meta-return  |
      | t            | Activate          | Activate         | Activate | None             |
      |--------------+-------------------+------------------+----------+------------------|


** EASILY CREATE YOUR OWN BUTTON TYPES

  *** Simple Action Link Button Type Creation: `defal' is a new,
      easy-to-use construct that generates new action button types from
      a type name and a single simple format expression, allowing
      non-programmers to create their own implicit action button link
      types that execute key series, display URLs, display the contents
      of pathnames or invoke functions.  See "(hyperbole)Action Button
      Link Types" or the "DEMO#Defining New Action Button Types"
      section.

  *** Easy Implicit Link Button Type Creation: `defil' is a new
      construct for those familiar with regular expressions but not
      much Emacs Lisp.  This creates more flexible implicit button
      types than `defal' where the delimiters and text substitution
      can be specified with regular expressions.  Actions are limited
      to executing key series, displaying URLs, displaying the
      contents of pathnames or invoking functions.  See
      "(hyperbole)Implicit Button Link Types".

      Elisp programmers should use the existing `defib' macro for full
      flexibility in implicit button type creation.  See "hibtypes.el"
      for examples and "(hyperbole)Programmatic Implicit Button Types"
      for documentation.


** TEST CASES

  *** Hyperbole Automated Testing: Extensive quality improvements throughout
      Hyperbole thanks in part to over 230 test cases now included in the
      test/ subdirectory.  Simply run 'make test-all' or 'make test' from the
      command-line when in the Hyperbole source directory and you should see
      all tests pass.  If any fail, you can press the Action Key to see the
      source of the failure.  Full testing is supported under POSIX systems
      only.  See "Makefile" and "test/MANIFEST".
 
  *** Implicit Button Types to Run Tests: The file "hypb-ert.el" contains two
      action link types:
        hyperbole-run-test  - run a single Hyperbole test by name
        hyperbole-run-tests - run one more tests matching a pattern
      
        Example uses:
          Run the test hbut-defal-url
            <hyperbole-run-test hbut-defal-url>

          Run the tests specified by the test selector hbut-defal
            <hyperbole-run-tests hbut-defal>

          Run all tests
            <hyperbole-run-tests t>
 
  *** Installation Testing: install-test/local-install-test.sh automatically
      installs Hyperbole for testing from one or more of its releases or
      development branches.  See "Makefile" and "install-test/MANIFEST".


** HYROLO  (See "(hyperbole)HyRolo").

  *** Faster searching within HyRolo match buffer: After performing a HyRolo
      search with point in the match buffer, if you want different results,
      you can quickly do a new regular expression HyRolo search with {r} or
      a string/logical search with {C-u r}.  This key had moved to previous
      matches but that is already bound to {Shift-TAB} and {M-TAB}.

  *** Auto-Expansion of Entries: If an entry is collapsed/hidden, moving to
      any hidden part auto-expands it and then re-collapses it when point is
      moved to another entry (just like isearch).  A side-effect of this is
      that the {h} hide entry subtree command now moves to the beginning of
      the entry.

  *** hyrolo-find-file: New command that selects and edits a file in
      `hyrolo-file-list', defaulting to the first listed file when not given
      a prefix arg.  Available in the minibuffer menu as Rolo/File and the
      pulldown menu as Rolo/Find-HyRolo-File.

  *** Sorting Entries Rewritten:  {C-h h r o} re-ordering HyRolo entries has
      been rewritten for compatibility and improved debugging with the latest
      Emacs releases.

  *** hyrolo-highlight-face: Now uses the Emacs 'match' face by default.

  *** Under MS Windows, the default HyRolo file is now "~/.rolo.otl" like
      all other operating systems, instead of "~/_rolo.otl".  Any older file
      name will be relocated to the newer name.


** KOUTLINER  (See "(hyperbole)Koutliner").

  *** Export Koutlines to Collapsible Web Pages: {C-h h k f d} or
      {M-x kexport:display RET} command creates and displays a web-based
      expandable/collapsible outline from the Koutline in the current buffer.
      See "(hyperbole)Exporting" and the new Koutliner Format submenu.

  *** Org File Importation: Org files may now be imported to a Koutline using
      {M-x kimport:file RET}.

  *** Org Table Support: Org table editing now automatically works in the
      Koutliner via Org table minor mode.  Use {M-x orgtbl-mode RET} to
      toggle this on and off.  A press of the Action Key on a | symbol,
      also toggles this minor mode on or off. See "(Org)Tables" for details.
      Use a prefix arg with {TAB} to promote/demote Koutline trees when in
      a table since {TAB} moves between fields within a table.

  *** New Tree Movement Commands: Like Org mode, {[M-down]} and {[M-up]} move
      the current tree past or before other trees at the same level.  With a
      prefix argument, move past that many trees.

  *** New Tree Promotion/Demotion Keys: Tree promotion and demotion keys now
      match many of the defaults in Org mode and Outline mode, plus some
      easier to type ones.  The tables below summarize which keys work whether
      inside an Org table or outside.  See "(hyperbole)Promoting and Demoting".

      |----------------------------+-----------------------------|
      | Promotion Inside Org Table | Demotion Inside Org Table   |
      |----------------------------+-----------------------------|
      | M-0 Shift-TAB or M-0 M-TAB | M-0 TAB                     |
      | C-c C-,                    | C-c C-.                     |
      | C-c C-<                    | C-c C->                     |
      |----------------------------+-----------------------------|

      |-----------------------------+----------------------------|
      | Promotion Outside Org Table | Demotion Outside Org Table |
      |-----------------------------+----------------------------|
      | Shift-TAB or M-TAB          | TAB                        |
      | M-left                      | M-right                    |
      | C-c C-,                     | C-c C-.                    |
      | C-c C-<                     | C-c C->                    |
      |-----------------------------+----------------------------|

  *** New Mail Tree Key Binding: The `kotl-mode:mail-tree' command that
      extracts the current view of a Koutline in text-only format and
      creates an outgoing email message with it, has moved from {C-c @}
      to {C-c C-@} to prevent conflict with the global hycontrol-window-grid
      command bound to {C-c @}.

  *** New Copy Command: The new command, `kotl-mode:copy-tree-or-region-to-buffer',
      bound to {C-c M-c} copies a Koutline tree or the active region
      to a specified buffer.  Prompts dictate whether invisible text
      is included or not.  This allows copying parts of Koutlines
      directly into other buffers without having to copy to a
      mail/message buffer first.

  *** Klink Copy: When `transient-mark-mode' is enabled and there is no active region:

        within a link to a Koutline cell (klink), {M-w} copies the klink; then
        {C-y} yanks it into any buffer you desire.

        {M-w} outside of a klink instead copies a reference to the current
        Koutline cell.

        {C-x r s} prompts for an Emacs register and saves either the current
        klink or the current cell reference to the register; {C-x r i} with the
        same register then inserts at point the saved Koutline reference.

      The new commands that you can bind to your own keys for copying klink
      references to the current cell to the kill ring and to registers are:
        kotl-mode:copy-absolute-klink-to-kill-ring
        kotl-mode:copy-relative-klink-to-kill-ring
        kotl-mode:copy-absolute-klink-to-register
        kotl-mode:copy-relative-klink-to-register

  *** Klinks Ignored Outside Comments in Programming Language Modes: In
      previous Hyperbole versions, this was true for C-based language
      modes.  Now it is true for any programming mode descended from
      `prog-mode'.

  *** Prevent Movement Outside Editable Cell Bounds: Add
      kotl-mode:pre-self-insert-command as a pre-command-hook
      to prevent Koutline editing with point in an invalid location,
      after a mouse-set-point outside of editable bounds.

  *** {C-h h k e} (kotl-mode:example): Update to allow for an optional
      directory or absolute file path.  Prompt for the path when interactive.
      Given a prefix argument, archive any existing file and start with a
      fresh EXAMPLE.kotl file for editing.  Programmatically, give a 2nd
      arg of t to force archiving of any existing file and starting with
      a fresh EXAMPLE.kotl file.

  *** Koutlines have a hidden top-level root cell 0 that allows referring
      to the whole outline as a tree.  Now attributes of this cell can be
      set, retrieved or removed like any other cell.

      {C-c h} prompts for a kcell id and displays its attributes.
      {C-u C-c h} prompts for a kcell id and displays the attributes for it
      and its subtree; use 0 as the kcell id to see attributes for all visible
      cells in the outline.

      {C-c C-i} sets an attribute of the cell at point.
      {C-u C-c C-i} removes an attribute of the cell at point.
      {C-0 C-c C-i} sets an attribute of the invisible 0 root cell.
      {C--1 C-c C-i} removes an attribute of the invisible 0 root cell.

  *** Modes to Ignore Klinks: C-style languages use <includes> that can be
      mistaken for klinks.  New customizations 'klink:ignore-modes' and
      'klink:c-style-modes' set the modes where klink matches are ignored.


** MENUS

  *** Minibuffer Menu Changes:
        - Items Activated by First Capital Letter: Used to be by the first
          letter.  This allows more flexibility in naming, e.g.
          where two items start with the same first letter.

        - {X} exits Hyperbole mode: This disables the Hyperbole minor mode
          completely and exits from the menu.  {C-h h} re-enables the
          global minor mode and display the top-level Hyperbole menu.

  *** Minibuffer and Pulldown Menu Changes:

        - Find/Web/Jump: Use the Emacs webjump library to select a URL by name
          and jump to it.

        - Koutliner Formatting Menus: Full set of commands to import
          text and outline files to Koutlines and to export Koutlines
	  to HTML for web viewing.  See "(hyperbole)Inserting and Importing"
          and "(hyperbole)Exporting".

        - Button Modify Commands Removed: Use the Edit commands instead.
          This applies to the pull-down menu as well.


** SMART (ACTION AND ASSIST) KEYS  (See "(hyperbole)Smart Keys").

  *** Explicit buttons may be created in any kind of temporary buffer
      without an attached file, similar to what already existed for mail
      message buffers.

  *** 'ls' and 'grep' Directory Changes:  'ls' listings are now recognized
      properly, prepending the preceding directory to each entry for viewing.

      Similarly, if a 'cd' or 'pushd' command is issued prior to a 'grep -n'
      or 'ripgrep' command, Hyperbole will prepend that directory to the grep
      output before jumping to the resultant path.

  *** Git Log Grep: New commands, 'hypb:fgrep-git-log' and 'hypb:grep-git-log',
      allow f/grepping over repo changesets and listing associated commit log
      messages.  The Action Key on any resulting log entry displays the commit
      changeset.

  *** Pathname Implicit Buttons: Much improved pathname handling including
      multiple variables per path, embedded . or .. within paths, better
      recognition of semicolon separated pathnames in Windows PATH variable.

      Variable substitutions are now made with fixed case, so that the
      case of a value with both upper and lower case characters is
      never changed, for example a value of ${HOME}.

      Generalized Anchored Pathnames:  "pathname#anchor" now works in
      programming modes as well as text and outlining modes where anchors
      are prefixed with the comment character in each mode or a # symbol.

      PATH-style Variable Support:  An Action Key press on a defined PATH-style
      variable name, e.g. MANPATH, will prompt with completion for one of the
      paths and will then display that.  If it is the colon or semicolon-
      separated string of paths value from a PATH-style variable, the path at
      point is displayed; empty paths, e.g. :: represents the current directory,
      ’.’.  Must have at least four paths within the variable value for this
      to work.

      file:// URLs are now resolved properly.

  *** Any Lisp or environment variable that stores a directory or set of
      directories may be prepended to any "grep -n" output line with the form
      "${var-name}/" and the Action Key will recognize the directory and display
      the appropriate line.

  *** Treat kbd Strings as Key Series Buttons: An Action Key press within
      the string of (kbd "string") issues the keys in string as if they were
      pressed individually, i.e. the same as the key series, {string}.

  *** Mail Address Activation Everywhere: Email addresses are recognized as
      implicit buttons in major modes descended from `mail-address-mode-list'.
      If you set that to nil, however, they will be recognized in all major
      modes.

  *** Magit Mode Support: Just click or press the Action Key somewhere and it
      will typically display what you want.  Extensive Action Key support in
      Magit modes for cycling through display views and displaying items.

      Action Mouse clicks on the modeline cycles display of commits/diffs in
      a buffer.  In Magit Log and Blame listing modes, the Action Key
      displays the associated commit or file line.  The Action Key also
      handles single line log entries that begin with the word 'commit' ,
      displaying their commits even from shell and compilation buffers.

  *** Debugger Source: In Python tracebacks, may be on a line just below the
      source reference line so if not on a Hyperbole button, move back a line
      before checking.

  *** Todotxt Mode Support: Smart key support for the todotxt mode
      https://github.com/rpdillon/todotxt.el.

  *** UNIX Shell Errors: Jump to associated source line from a shell error of the
      form:  "<pathname>: line <num>: ".

  *** Internet RFC Links (e.g. RFC-822): Change to using http to retrieve RFCs
      instead of ftp since this is disabled in many environments.  Always display
      with Emacs' web browser rather than externally.

  *** Implicit Button Types Reprioritization: Modified "hibtypes.el" so if
      evaluate: (symset:clear 'ibtypes) and then reload hibtypes.{el,elc},
      the priority order of all implicit button types is reset.


** CUSTOMIZATION

  *** Customizable Display Program File Mappings:
      The variables:
         hpath:internal-display-alist
         hpath:external-display-alist-macos
         hpath:external-display-alist-mswindows
         hpath:external-display-alist-x)
      are all customizable and their default values utilize the per operating
      system generic 'open' commands based on file suffix associations (for file
      types not handled by Emacs).

      The new customizable variable, `hpath:external-file-suffixes', holds a regular
      expression of operating system independent file suffixes to open outside Emacs
      with the Action Key when not handled by `hpath:native-image-suffixes'.


** PROGRAMMING

  *** With the Hyperbole menu Cust/Debug-Toggle enabled, the messages printed
      for each Smart Key press now include the action type and its arguments
      for improved debugging.

  *** Edebuggable Hyperbole Types: `defib' and `defact' type definitions
      are now interactively debuggable via edebug-defun {C-M-x}.

  *** ebut:program: Programmatically create an explicit Hyperbole button at
      point from LABEL, ACTYPE (action type), and optional actype ARGS.

  *** gbut:ebut-program: Programmatically add global explicit buttons at the
      end of the personal button file.
      
  *** kbd-key implicit button type: Interactive creation now allows for
      a full key series, not just a single key binding.

  *** kbd-key:is-p: Added this new predicate to test whether point is within
      a brace-delimited key series.

  *** kbd-key:execute: Added to programmatically or interactively execute a
      non-normalized key series stored in a string.

  *** hypb:def-to-buffer: Quick copying of program definitions and insertion
      at the start of another buffer.  Can be bound and used in key series.

  *** smart-lisp-find-tag: New function that automatically finds tags tables
      and jumps to Emacs Lisp definitions.  It can be used in any type
      of file as an action button, e.g. <smart-lisp-find-tag "ibut:at-p">.

  *** ibut:at-p: Trigger an error if any implicit button type predicate
      permanently moves point to simplify debugging such predicates.

  *** hypb:string-count-matches: Count regexp matches in a string.


** ACE WINDOW PACKAGE INTEGRATION - fast window and buffer switching

  *** After installing the ace-window package and loading Hyperbole, execute
      (hkey-ace-window-setup "\M-o") to enable the following capabilities:

  *** Fast Window Links: The hkey-window-link command bound to {M-o w}
      rapidly creates a link button at point in the selected window,
      linking to point in the window chosen when prompted.
      See "DEMO#Displaying File and Buffer Items and Moving Buffers".

  *** Throw A Region Elsewhere Within the Same Buffer: {M-o t <window-id>}
      when used with a selected region can now throw to the source buffer
      as long as point is outside the selected region in the target window.

===========================================================================
*                                   V7.1.3
===========================================================================

  SMART (ACTION AND ASSIST) KEYS

    - Global Org Link Activation: The Action Key now activates Org links in
      non-Org buffers if 'inhibit-hsys-org' is nil (the default).  The Assist
      Key shows help.

    - Org Agenda Item Display: The Action Key displays the Org node
      associated with Agenda items such as TODOs in another window.  The
      Assist Key shows help.

    - Org Mode: Raised to near top priority in implicit button types so that
      pathnames, URLs, etc. within Org links are handled by Org rather than
      Hyperbole.

    - Smart Dired Sidebar: Smart Key support for the dired-sidebar
      package.  See "(hyperbole)Smart Key - Dired Sidebar Mode".

    - Helm Mode:  The Smart Keys do all sorts of things in helm completion buffers
      and the associated minibuffer.  See "(hyperbole)Smart Key - Helm Mode".

    - Magit Mode: Action Key expands/collapses like {TAB} and Assist Key
      jumps to items like {RET}.  See "(hyperbole)Smart Key - Magit Mode".

  BUTTON TYPES

    - {Key Series} Button Support for Helm and Counsel: Key series buttons
      with M-x commands now work properly when counsel-mode or helm-mode are
      enabled and M-x is rebound.

    - Markdown In-file Links: With point on the link title, in-file links are
      now activated properly (previously point had to be on the link itself).

    - Git#directory Buttons: New flag, hibtypes-git-use-magit-flag, which if
      set to t and Magit is available, then when activating a git directory
      button, such as git#/hyperbole, use Magit rather than Dired.

    - Explicit Buttons Work Immediately: Previously you had to save the buffer
      in which you created an explicit button before it would work.  Now they
      work immediately after creation.

  DOCUMENTATION

    - Helm Mode: Added Hyperbole Manual section, "Smart Key - Helm Mode"
      that works on helm completions.  See "(hyperbole)Smart Key -
      Helm Mode".

    - Hyperbole Slides: Slides used in a talk by the author on the history
      and capabilities of Hyperbole, see "HY-TALK/HY-TALK.org".

    - Magit Mode: Added Hyperbole Manual section, "Smart Key - Magit Mode"
      that expands/collapses/jumps to Magit items.  See "(hyperbole)Smart Key -
      Magit Mode".

===========================================================================
*                                   V7.1.2
===========================================================================

  BUTTON TYPES

    - Link Creation via Drag: Automatic link referent detection has been
      expanded.  You can now drag the Smart Mouse Key across windows or use
      'hkey-operate' to create an explicit link button to an Emacs
      Bookmark or to a Texinfo Node.

    - link-to-texinfo-node Action Type: Now takes a first file parameter,
      rather than working only on the current buffer.

  KOUTLINER

    - Visual Command Support: Use of these additional Emacs commands:
      beginning-of-visual-line, end-of-visual-line,  and kill-visual-line.

  MENUS

    - Global Key Bindings for Hyperbole Menu Items: Use
      {M-x hyperbole-set-key RET} to create a shorter global key binding
      to any Hyperbole minibuffer item.

    - Gbut/Create: When invoked with a prefix argument, will create a
      global implicit button rather than an explicit button.  Simple provide
      a name/label and the text of the implicit button including delimiters.

    - Gbut/Delete: Added to delete explicit or implicit global buttons.

    - Gbut/Modify: The name/label and the text (and thus the action) of global
      implicit buttons may now be modified.  Hyperbole automatically determines
      whether a button is explicit or implicit from the button name selected.

   MOUSE

    - Click Emacs Buttons with Left Mouse Button: When using mouse-1
      to follow Emacs buttons/links, Emacs actually uses the binding
      of mouse-2.  With unshifted Hyperbole mouse keys, this mouse-2
      binding is incompatible as it is the Action Key.  This release
      resolves this problem and allows either mouse-1 or mouse-2 to be
      used to click on native Emacs buttons.

    - Drag and Drop Region with Left Mouse Button: When
      'mouse-drag-and-drop-region' is non-nil and a region is active,
      Hyperbole now properly supports using mouse-1 to visually drag from
      within the region and drop the text somewhere else.  Then click the
      left mouse button again to de-activate the dropped region before
      typing.

===========================================================================
*                                   V7.1.1
===========================================================================

  DEMO

    - Global Buttons: Added a new example of a labeled global implicit button
      displaying a todo file maintained in Koutliner format.  See
      "DEMO#Global Buttons".

    - Within one Emacs session, invoking the DEMO with {C-h h d d} now leaves
      point where it was so you can continue working your way through it.

    - You can now move between matching < and > as well as { and } delimiter
      pairs with {C-M-n} and {C-M-p}.

  BUTTON TYPES

    - Gbut/Rename: Added renaming of global explicit and named labeled
      buttons.

    - {kbd-key} Key Series: Greatly expanded the keys handled by
      brace-delimited implicit key series buttons.  Added support for
      <TAB>, <BS>, C-M-, non-ASCII CONTROL and META key codes, keypad
      keys, function keys, and these modifier keys: CONTROL, ALT,
      HYPER, META, SUPER and SHIFT (when whitespace separated).

    - Action Implicit Buttons: May now start with Lisp special forms like
      'progn' and 'or'.

    - Longer Button Labels: The default max length of a Hyperbole button
      label has been increased from 100 to 200 characters.  The variable
      hbut:max-len controls this.  If you locally set this to 0 in any
      new button type definition, then for that type of button, there
      will be no maximum limit.  Since Action Implicit Buttons can be
      a series of Lisp calls, they are now unlimited in length.

===========================================================================
*                                   V7.1.0
===========================================================================

  BUTTON TYPES

    - In-buffer Labels: Fixed a number of in-buffer text handling issues with
      the creation of explicit buttons, maximizing reuse of existing text in
      labels.

    - link-to-file Action Type: Extended to allow file path to include either
      :line-num:column-num or just :line-num at the end (translated to character
      location within the button).

  DOCUMENTATION

    - Bookmark Mode: Added Hyperbole Manual section, "Smart Key - Bookmark Mode"
      that allows linking to Emacs Bookmarks.  See "(hyperbole)Smart Key -
      Bookmark Mode".

  MENUS

    - Activate Any Labeled Buffer Button: Hyperbole's top-level menu 'Act'
      command either activates any button at point or prompts for the choice of
      any labeled explicit or implicit button within the buffer to activate.
      The pulldown menu item, Activate-Button-in-Buffer, behaves the same.

    - Org-mode in Q&A Appendix: Rewrote this section to account for improved
      integration.

===========================================================================
*                                   V7.0.9
===========================================================================

  Many issues were resolved in this test version as documented in "Changes".
  Only new features are documented here.

  ACE WINDOW PACKAGE INTEGRATION - fast window and buffer switching

    - After installing the ace-window package and loading Hyperbole, execute
      (hkey-ace-window-setup "\M-o") to enable the following capabilities:

    - Region Throws: The hkey-throw command bound to {M-o t} now throws the
      active (highlighted) region, if any, into the target window's buffer,
      rather than replacing its buffer with the source window buffer.  If
      you don't use region highlighting, i.e. transient-mark-mode, then use
      {C-u M-o t} for the same effect.  The buffer in the target window
      must differ from the one in the source window.  With no region
      active, this command still throws the source buffer to the target
      window.  See "DEMO#Displaying File and Buffer Items and Moving Buffers".

  SMART (ACTION AND ASSIST) KEYS

    - Modeline Drag Window Resizing: Smart Key window resizing now provides
      live feedback during the drag.

    - Bottommost Modeline Frame Moving: After adding a 'drag-with-mode-line'
      frame parameter with a value of t, a drag of any of its bottommost
      modelines with either Smart Mouse Key repositions the frame on screen.
      See "(hyperbole)Moving Frames" for information on how to configure this
      feature.

  CUSTOMIZATION

    - hproperty:flash-face: Face used when flashing a button; now customizable.

    - hproperty:highlight-face: Face used to highlight a line; now customizable.

    - inhibit-hsys-org: See ORG MODE section below.

  GLOSSARY

    - Hlink Definitions: Added Action Button, Elink, Ilink, Glink definitions.

  HYCONTROL

    - Windows Grid by File Pattern: {C--1 C-c @} prompts for a glob-type file
      pattern, finds all the matching files and then displays them in an auto-sized
      windows grid based on the number of files.

    - Autosize Windows Grid of Marked Items: When in a Dired, Buffer Menu or IBuffer
      buffer and items are marked, {@} will display them in an auto-sized window grid
      rather than prompting for a size.

    - Buffer/Window Swapping: Improved {~} so current buffer remains the same but
      the selected window changes.  Also made frame buffer swapping work anytime
      there are two or more frames regardless of how many windows in each.  See
      "DEMO#Swapping Buffers".

    - HyControl Now Accepts Negative Prefix Args: If the minus key is pressed when
      HyControl is invoked or after any other prefix arg command, it will invert the
      current prefix arg value (or when zero, set the prefix arg to -1).

  HYROLO

    - Hyrolo Add: Fixed new entry addition to add in sorted order and make logic
      operators perform properly, after a bug in level calculation had been
      introduced.

  IMPLICIT BUTTONS

    - Double Quoting Key Series: Key series delimited by {} may now be in double
      quotes, e.g. "{C-x o}".

    - Windows to Posix Paths: Much improved conversion of MSWindows UNC paths to
      existing Posix mount points when running Emacs under Windows Subsystem for
      Linux.  See

    - Flashing Implicit Buttons: More types of implicit buttons now flash when
      activated.

    - Improved Grep Output Parsing: Recognizes file names with spaces followed by
      the null (^@, ASCII 0) character.

    - Texinfo @-Quoted Path Variables: Hyperbole now can resolve paths as
      complicated as this: @file{$@{hyperb:dir@}/DEMO#POSIX and MSWindows Paths}
      in Texinfo files if the Action Key is pressed on the / or after, i.e. after
      the variable name.

  KEYS

    - Deleted C-c C-r Global Binding: Removed {C-c C-r} key binding for explicit
      button renaming due to conflicts with some major modes

  ORG MODE

    - Implicit Button Support: Org-mode's local binding of {M-RET} by default
      now activates Hyperbole implicit buttons when within them.

    - inhibit-hsys-org: New customization that when set non-nil disables
      all Smart Key support in any Org major or minor mode.

    - hsys-org-hbut-activate-p: Added to org-metareturn-hook so local binding
      of {M-RET} in org-mode activates Hyperbole buttons when point is over
      them. (It doesn't run the full set of Action Key actions).


  PROGRAMMING

    - Auto Imenu Reindexing: If using Emacs imenu package, the Action Key
      will look up in-buffer identifier references with imenu.  If imenu's
      index is rendered invalid due to large changes in a buffer, Hyperbole
      will now automatically rebuild the index to have correct pointers.
      (Does not require use of the imenu-auto-rescan setting.

    - hypb:mark-object: Gives Hyperbole-specific strings and symbols
      a hyperbole property that distinguishes them from other objects.

    - hypb:object-p: Tests whether has the hyperbole property.  This is useful
      in hpath:relative-to and hpath:absolute-to where any string with a
      hyperbole property is ignored as a potential path.  For example, this
      prevents removal of trailing whitespace from normalized key series.

    - hbut:act: Hyperbole button parameter is now optional and defaults to
      the located button, the symbol, 'hbut:current.

    - ibtypes tag lookup: Implicit button type names such as ibtypes::grep-msg
      are now properly found in tags tables using their defib names
      (e.g. grep-msg).

    - hmouse-drag-p: tests whether absolute Smart Mouse Key depress and
      release positions differ (relative to display/screen coordinates).

    - hycontrol-quit: Unified the two Hycontrol mode quit commands into this one.
      hycontrol-abort: Renamed from hycontrol-abort-mode.

    - hyperb:autoloads-exist-p
      hyperb:maybe-generate-autoloads
      hyperb:generate-autoloads: Added and called from hyperb:init when
      initializing Hyperbole to generate auto-autoload files when
      running from a non-packaged source download of Hyperbole.


===========================================================================
*                                   V7.0.8
===========================================================================

  BUTTONS

    - Action Buttons: A new, universal syntax for creating implicit buttons
      that execute any existing action types or Elisp functions.  Such
      buttons are delimited by angle brackets, < >, and come in three types:
      action type invocations, function calls and variable displays.  See
      "(hyperbole)Action Buttons" for examples and details on this exciting
      new capability.

    - Labeled Implicit Buttons: Optional <[labels]> that precede implicit
      buttons.  This enables implicit buttons to be activated by name when
      in the current buffer or anywhere when added to the global buttons
      file (personal button file).

    - Link to Buttons: New implicit button types that link to buttons based
       on their categories and labels:

        In Buffer Syntax                                       Implicit Button Type
        ===========================================================================
        <elink: explicit button label to link to: optional ebut file>  link-to-ebut
        <glink: global button label to link to>                        link-to-gbut
        <ilink: implicit button label to link to: optional ibut file>  link-to-ibut

    - Other New Implicit Button Types:
        debugger-source: Jump to the source of errors from the Python pytype package
        ipython-stack-frame: Jump to the source of ipython stack traces and exceptions

    - Other New Action Types:
        link-to-bookmark: Display an Emacs bookmark

    - Much Faster Implicit Buttons: Major speedup in implicit button identification
      and activation even with the new generalized Action implicit button type
      syntax, due to internal optimizations.

    - Pathname Flashing: Pathname implicit buttons now flash when activated.

    - Pathname References: Pathname implicit buttons may contain both link anchors
      and line and column numbers.  Format is:
        "<path>[#<link-anchor>]:<line-num>[:<col-num>]"

    - Shell Script Link Anchors: Link anchors now work for shell script editing modes
      as well using comment lines as the anchors, e.g. "myscript.sh#Env Variables".

    - Dir Variable Separators: Variables in paths no longer require a trailing directory
      separator.  Both of these are live Hyperbole paths:
	  "${hyperb:dir}DEMO#Smart Mouse Keys"
	  "${hyperb:dir}/DEMO#Smart Mouse Keys"

    - Jump Thing: Added xml-mode support for pressing the Action Key when on a start or
      end tag pair to select the whole region between them.  {C-c .} also moves between
      the start and matching end tag.  See "(hyperbole)Smart Key Thing Selection".

      now changes to whatever the default number of lines per cell is
      (typically, unlimited).  The same goes for the 'l' spec (limit display
      to a certain level of cells).

  MENUS

    - Pulldown Menus:   Implicit-Button/Label: Added to add a label.
                        Implicit-Button/Rename - Added to rename the label
                        of an implicit button.

    - Minibuffer Menus: hui-mini.el (hui:menus): Added Ibut/Label and
      Ibut/Rename.


  ORG MODE

    - Radio Targets and Links: Smart Keys now handle these.

    - Links: Smart Keys handle both internal and external Org mode links.


  PROGRAMMING

    - ibut:at-type-p: Added to test if point is on a specific type of
      implicit button.

    - hbut:key, ebut:key, ibut:key, hbut:rename, hui:hbut-rename,
      hui:hbut-operate: Added to allow renaming of any type of labeled
      Hyperbole button.

    - hypb:region-with-text-property-value: Added and used in hysy-org.el.

    - hsys-org-mode-function, hsys-org-mode-p: Added to determine when
      hsys-org actions are activated.

    - ebut:key-src-set-buffer, hbut:key-src-set-buffer, hbut:key-list,
      hbut:ebut-key-list, hbut:ibut-key-list, hbut:label-list): Added
      to allow selection of labeled Hyperbole buttons in current buffer by
      name.

    - gbut:get, hbut:map, ibut:label-map, ibut:key-src, ibut:key-to-label,
      ibut:label-to-key, hui:ebut-act, ibut:summarize, ibut:label-start,
      ibut:label-end, ibut:label-p, ibut:get, hui:ibut-label-create,
      hui:ibut-rename, hui:ibut-message, ibut:alist, ibut:list, ibut:map,
      ibut:next-occurrence, ibut:label-regexp, gbut:ibut-key-list, ebut:to,
      gbut:to, ibut:to, ibut:label-separator, hbut:label-regexp,

      ibut:label-separator-regexp, hbut:outside-comment-p: Added.

    - elink, elink:start, elink:end: Added for in-buffer links to explicit buttons.
      glink, glink:start, glink:end: Added for in-buffer links to global buttons.
      ilink, ilink:start, ilink:end: Added for in-buffer links to implicit buttons.

    - hsys-org-set-ibut-label: Added and used in org-mode ibtype.
      org-mode, hsys-org-at-block-start-p: Added Action Key activation of
      Org blocks when on 1st line of def.


  SMART (ACTION AND ASSIST) KEYS

    - Emacs Bookmark Menu Mode: Jump to the bookmark at point.

    - hpath:find-program: Changed to prioritize hpath:native-image-suffixes
      over hpath:internal-display-alist over hpath:external-display-alist-macos
      instead of the reverse.  This prevents external viewers from being
      used when internal viewers are also in effect.


===========================================================================
*                                   V7.0.3
===========================================================================

  ACE WINDOW PACKAGE INTEGRATION - fast window and buffer switching

    - After installing the ace-window package and loading Hyperbole, execute
      (hkey-ace-window-setup "\M-o") to enable the following capabilities:

    - Selected Window Buffer Replace: Added the ability to 'replace' the
      selected window's buffer with the buffer of another window.  Use
      {M-o r <window-id>}.  To swap the buffers between the same two windows,
      use {M-o m <window-id>.  See "(hyperbole)Keyboard Drags" for setup and
      use instructions.

    - New Frame Commands: Any of these M-o commands that involve two windows
      can use a new frame as the target window by using a <window-id> of 'z'.
      So, {M-o t z} throws the current buffer to a new frame with a single
      window displaying that buffer.  The new frame will be the same size as
      the prior frame to match the behavior of HyControl.

    - Integrated Ace Window commands with Smart Key Drags and added commands
      for use with the mouse that select Ace Window source and target windows
      by clicking with the mouse: hmouse-click-to-drag,
      hmouse-click-to-drag-stay, hmouse-click-to-drag-to,
      hmouse-click-to-replace, hmouse-click-to-swap, hmouse-click-to-throw.

    - {M-o i <window-id>} is now for use only when on a listing item such as
      in Dired or Buffer Menu.  It no longer creates Hyperbole buttons in
      non-item areas to avoid confusion.  Now it will just trigger an error
      if not on a listing item.

  SMART (ACTION AND ASSIST) KEYS

    - MSWindows Paths: Hyperbole now recognizes typical MSWindows paths (both
      local and remote shares) and can convert an in-buffer path between POSIX
      and MSWindows formats multiple times, even paths involving mount points.
      See "DEMO#POSIX and MSWindows Paths".

      MSWindows paths may be used within links and implicit path
      buttons just like POSIX paths, whether running Emacs under a POSIX
      system or MSWindows.  If under POSIX, a remote MSWindows path must be
      accessed through a mount point to the network share.  Hyperbole caches
      such mount points when it is loaded.  Use {M-x
      hpath:cache-mswindows-mount-points RET} to update them if more mounts
      are made later.  See also the NEW COMMANDS section herein for how to
      convert a path between POSIX and MSWindows formats.

    - GitLab and Github Links: Added Gitlab implicit links with equivalent
      functionality to those of Github.  Added "people" reference support to
      list people who are part of a formal organization as well as a "staff"
      alias.  Added "contributors" reference support to list project
      contributors as well.  Improved Github implicit issue links: gh#gh-34
      and gh#issue/34 now properly reference an issue in the current project.

    - Ripgrep: Added new ripgrep-msg implicit button type which jumps
      to the source referenced by ripgrep (rg) output.  By default,
      ripgrep outputs pathnames only once before all matching lines
      within that path.  Ripgrep may also be used with the Hyperbole
      `hypb:rgrep' command by setting 'hypb:rgrep-command'.  See
      "https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep".

    - Markdown Mode: Smart Keys now support Markdown internal file link
      references and navigation.

    - Org Mode: When in an *Org Help* buffer, the Smart Keys now defer to
      org-mode to handle jumps to its own locations for compatibility.
      Similarly, in org-mode buffers when not on an Org link or heading,
      and the {M-RET} Action Key is pressed, Hyperbole defers to Org's
      org-meta-return command.  Hyperbole bindings of {C-c RET}, {C-c .}
      and {C-c @} also defer to org-mode.

    - Drag-based Kill, Copy and Yank: Added support for dragging across
      frames.

    - Python Identifiers: If a Jedi server is running and the Action Key is
      pressed on a Python identifier, Hyperbole will use Jedi to find the
      definition even within nested module references, e.g. a.b.c.  Also
      improved basic identifier definition finding.

    - Company Mode Completion: Support for the Emacs company-mode completion
      package.  An Action Key press on a company-mode completion item will
      display the definition of that item and an Assist Key press will
      display its documentation, if any.

    - Treemacs Mode: Now supports standard Hyperbole end-of-line proportional
      scrolling.

    - ChangeLog Mode: Smart Keys now work on Emacs Lisp references in
      changelogs.

    - Improved String Matching: For lines that begin with part of a string
      that started on another line, Hyperbole now presumes that point is
      within a string rather than between two strings, even though the
      delimiters on the line make this ambiguous.  This provides more
      accurate string recognition.

    - Improved Path Matching: For quote delimited paths, other quote marks
      are excluded from matches, so if checking for a doubly quoted path,
      single quotes are not allowed in the string.

  HYCONTROL

    - Help Buffer Quitting: If HyControl is active, normally {q} quits
      it, but now if point is in an Emacs help buffer, {q} will quit
      from the help buffer instead.  Use {Q} to quit from HyControl
      unconditionally.

  NEW COMMANDS

    - Buffer Sliding:  Four new commands are available that can be
      bound to things like control arrow keys: hkey-buffer-move-left,
      hkey-buffer-move-right, hkey-buffer-move-down and
      hkey-buffer-move-up.  Each one slides the current buffer one
      window in the direction specified and all other buffers slide
      around to match.

    - MSWindows and POSIX Path Toggling: In "hpath.el", added
      (hpath:substitute-posix-or-mswindows-at-point) and
      (hpath:substitute-posix-or-mswindows) commands to toggle the
      format of a path at point or in a string between POSIX and
      MSWindows styles.

  PROGRAMMING

    - Added hypb:map-plist, equivalent to mapcar but maps over
      key-value pairs in property lists (where the key and value are
      individual elements in the list).

    - In "hui-select.el", added functions to return info. on the
      context-sensitive region that this library selects.
      (hui-select-get-region) returns the region that would be
      selected at point and (hui-select-get-region-boundaries)
      returns a cons of the start and end position of the same region.

    - In "hpath.el (hpath:delimited-possible-path), added optional
      include-positions parameter which if non-nil, adds start and end
      positions to returned value.

    - In "hversion.el", added (hyperb:wsl-os-p) flag to test whether
      Emacs is running under Microsoft Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL)
      since the system-type variable does not reflect this.

  DOCUMENTATION

    - Popup Menus: Documented how to invoke the Koutliner and
      HyRolo popup menus in Emacs.  See "(hyperbole)Menu Commands".

    - DEMO: Added sections:
        "DEMO#Gitlab (Remote) References"
        "DEMO#POSIX and MSWindows Paths"

        (See the "Changes" file for even more details of changes).

  BUTTONS AND SMART (ACTION AND ASSIST) KEYS

    - Git References: New implicit button and action type with a compact syntax
        that displays many types of git entities, e.g. git#commit/55a1f0.  Such
        references work across all git repositories on your local disks.

        See "DEMO#Git (Local) References" or the commentary at the top of the
        "hib-social.el" file for extensive examples of these references.  {C-h
        f git-reference RET} explains its syntax.

    - Github References: New implicit button and action type with a compact
        syntax that displays many types of github entities,
        e.g. gh#emacs-helm/helm/1878, displays issue #1878 for user emacs-helm
        and project helm.  See "DEMO#Github (Remote) References" or the
        commentary at the top of the "hib-social.el" file for extensive
        examples of these references.  {C-h f github-reference RET} explains
        its syntax.

    - Extensive new support for cross-window and cross-frame drags of the
      Action and Assist Mouse Keys.  See "DEMO#Smart Mouse Keys" and the Info
      manual section, "(hyperbole)Smart Mouse Key Drags" for details.  These
      actions allow for rapid display of buffers, windows and frames wherever
      you like.

      Major new features include:

        * Dragging items from Dired or the Buffer Menu for display in existing
          or new windows and frames.  Action Key drag from the first line (or
          header line) to another window to move the listing buffer itself.
          Visual pulsing of source and destination to highlight the transfer
          taking place (hmouse-pulse-flag controls this).  A following click on
          an item displays it in the source window, replacing the Dired or
          Buffer Menu listing.

        * Dragging from a buffer or an item to a modeline splits the window of
          the modeline and displays the buffer/item dragged in the leftmost
	  or uppermost of the split windows.

        * Cloning or moving an Emacs window to a similarly sized new frame or
	  another existing frame.

        * Displaying a buffer in specific other windows.

        * With Emacs 26 on macOS, Hyperbole detects the window of any drag
          release or whether the release was outside of Emacs, e.g. in another
	  application whose window is atop an Emacs frame (uses a Python script
	  included with Hyperbole, so Python must be available or this will do
	  nothing).

          The hmouse-verify-release-window-flag (default is t) controls whether
          checking for non-Emacs areas on macOS is done or not, as this slows
          Smart Key action handling at least 1/3 of a second in a number of cases.

    - {}-delimited Key Sequence Implicit Buttons have been greatly expanded.
      An Action Key press on any of the following execute the associated commands:
        {M-x occur RET}                 - M-x extended commands
        {M-x apropos RET hyperbole RET} - commands with arguments
	{C-x 2 C-x 3}                   - sequences of commands
	{ESC: (+ 2 3) RET}              - lisp expressions

    - Pathname Environment Variables: Implicit Buttons may contain environment
      variables such as "${PATH}/python" and Hyperbole resolves them to the
      first matching directory when activated.

    - Compressed Elisp: Quoted, compressed Emacs Lisp source file names without
      any path now work as implicit buttons that display the source file, with
      or without the compressed file suffix, e.g. "subr.el" or "subr.el.gz".

    - Prefixed URLs: Partial URLs with prefixes such as, url:photos.google.com
      or url=calendar.google.com, can now be displayed with Action Key presses
      even though they lack a www site name or an http protocol prefix.

    - Link to File: When modifying an explicit file link button, a variable in
      a pathname is maintained as is any prior in-file location when prompting
      for changes.

    - Yanking Explicit Buttons: When copying or moving explicit buttons, they
      are now re-highlighted when yanked into a new position.

    - EWW Support: Added Action and Assist Key support for browsing links in
      eww (the Emacs web browser) and for activating history links in the eww
      history buffer.

    - Open Office Documents: An Action Key press on an Open Office pathname
      displays it in Open Office.  See hpath:external-open-office-suffixes for
      file suffixes supported.

    - macOS Apps: An Action Key press on a pathname that ends in ".app" on a
      macOS system will run the app externally (previously it would have been
      browsed as a directory).

    - File Page Browsing: Dynamic table-of-contents-type browsing for files
      separated into pages with form-feed (Control-L) page separators.  Use
      {M-x pages-directory RET} to generate the listing of pages and then press
      the Action Key on any entry to jump to it.

    - Explicit Buttons in Comments: Explicit buttons in programming languages
      are now matched only within comments to avoid language syntax that looks
      like the delimiters of an explicit button, e.g. in Rust.

    - New hproperty:but-highlight-flag: This controls whether Hyperbole
      explicit buttons are highlighted with a special colored face or not.  By
      default, they are.

    - Python Backtraces: Action Key presses jump to the associated source
      line.

    - Python Symbols: Action Key presses now look these up in any buffer whose
      name includes Pydoc: or Python, mainly help buffers.

    - Compressed File Grep: {C-h h f g} now uses zgrep when available to
      handle compressed source files.

    - Grep -A Support: The grep -A option produces context lines around any
      matched lines but uses a different syntax for separating line numbers at
      the beginning of lines.  The Action Key now supports jumping to the
      source of any such lines.

    - Dired Quit: An Action Key press at the end of the first line in a Dired
      buffer now quits and executes requested actions, just as presses at the
      end of the buffer do.

    - Image Thumbnail Browsing: See the Info manual section,
      "(emacs)Image-Dired", for how to create a buffer of image thumbnails.
      Once created, the Action Key displays a scaled version of the original
      image in an Emacs window.  The Assist Key displays the original image in
      an external viewer.

    - Emacs Push-buttons: An Assist Key press on an Emacs push-button previously
      displayed its keyboard-action help string but not its mouse-action help
      string.  Now it displays the mouse-action when appropriate.

    - Texinfo References: An Action Key press on an Emacs Lisp @findex
      (function) or @vindex (variable) entry displays the documentation for
      that entry.

    - Debbugs Issues: Eliminated match of #id-number as a bug reference; 'bug'
      or similar prefix is now required so there is no ambiguity with social
      references including 'git #commit-number'.

  CUSTOMIZATION

    - Smart Key Hooks: New hooks run before and after Smart Key depress and
      release events: action-key-depress-hook, action-key-release-hook,
      assist-key-depress-hook and assist-key-release-hook.

  DOCUMENTATION

    - FAST-DEMO: New, simplified introductory demo to Hyperbole focused on
      implicit buttons.  Includes links to Hyperbole videos and the prior
      "DEMO".  {C-h h d d} display "FAST-DEMO" and {C-u C-h h d d} displays
      the prior "DEMO".

    - Why Use Hyperbole: "HY-WHY.kotl" lists use cases for Hyperbole with
      hyperlinks to associated "DEMO" sections for each.  View this via
      the minibuffer menu with {C-h h d w} or via the `Why-Use?' Hyperbole
      menubar menu entry.

    - Hyperbole HTML Manual: The HTML version of the Hyperbole Manual now uses
      the same css stylesheet as used for the Hyperbole Home page, making
      it look much better and easier to navigate.

    - Drags: Updated Hyperbole Manual with all new Smart Mouse Key drag actions.

    - Smart Key Help: Improved help documentation for Smart Keys when they
      contain multiple clauses connected with 'or' logic, e.g. do 'a' or 'b'
      or 'c'.

    - New Hyperbole Manual Sections:
        * Referent Display - setting of where link referents are displayed
        * Smart Mouse Key Drags
        * Smart Mouse Drags outside a Window
        * Smart Key - Image Thumbnails
	* Future Work - Direct Manipulation

    - Git References: In the Implicit Buttons section of the Hyperbole Manual,
      added documentation for git-reference, git-commit-reference and
      github-reference.

    - Toggle Key Bindings: In the Smart Key Bindings section of the Hyperbole
      Manual, explained hyperbole-toggle-bindings (toggles keyboard and mouse
      keys) rather than hmouse-toggle-bindings (toggles only mouse keys).
      Moved the latter to the Global Key Bindings appendix.

    - Other Hyperbole Manual Section Changes:
        * Button Colors: Added doc on hproperty:but-highlight-flag.
        * Glossary: Added Windows Grid entry.
        * Hook Variables: Added doc of: action-key-depress-hook,
          action-key-release-hook, assist-key-depress-hook
          and assist-key-release-hook.
        * HyControl: Added Google Contacts use and additional Concept Index entries.
        * Koutliner: Centralized all key binding index entries under "koutliner, ".
        * Manual Overview: Improved pointer to DEMO.
        * Smart Key - WWW URLs: Added browse-url-browser-function and Cust/URL-Display reference.
        * Using URLs with Find-File: Added URL browser customization menu reference and image.

    - New DEMO File Sections:
        * Table of Contents Browsing
        * Dragging Buffers, Windows and Items
        * HyControl Frame Commands and Windows Grid subsections
	* HyRolo
        * Running Dired on the Current Directory

  HYCONTROL

    - HyControl Minor Modes: HyControl is now two minor modes, one for frames
      and one for windows.  It uses standard key bindings and standard Emacs
      event processing instead of its own event loop, so any keys not bound in
      a HyControl mode now work normally.  HyControl Windows Mode displays
      HyWin in the modeline and HyControl Frames Mode displays HyFrm while
      active.  Both modes invert the modeline colors so you don't forget you
      are in a special mode.

    - {@} is an incredible new key binding and command that creates a grid of
      windows within a frame by splitting the frame into a number of equally
      sized windows specified by a number of rows and columns (typically as
      prefix arg digits).  Each window shows a different buffer, if possible,
      with a prefix arg of 0 prompting for a major mode and first displaying
      buffers of that mode.

      The same {@} command works in Dired, Buffer Menu and IBuffer modes and
      first displays any items marked for display in the windows grid,
      i.e. marked with the {m} command.

      Hyperbole also supplies the global key binding {C-c @} so this command
      can be used at any time.

      The variable, hycontrol-display-buffer-predicate-list, determines which
      buffers are first displayed in the grid except when filtering by major
      mode or by items marked in a listing buffer.

      {M-x hycontrol-windows-grid-repeatedly RET} allows rapid visual testing
      of different grid layouts or filters as it prompts you for a grid size,
      displays it and then prompts you again until your press RET without
      giving a size.

      See "Demo#Windows Grid" for example use.

    - {a} adjusts the selected frame width by cycling through a list of common
      fixed percentages such as 25% and 50% (given by the variable,
      hycontrol-frame-widths.

      {A} does the same for the selected frame's height, using
      hycontrol-frame-heights.

    - {f} now clones a window to a new frame without deleting the source window
      {F} moves a window to a new frame and deletes the the source window

    - {i}, {j}, {k}, {m} first expand the selected frame to an edge based on
      their respective positions on a U.S. keyboard, e.g. {i} expands the
      frame to the top edge; with further invocations, they keep the frame at
      that edge but cut its perpendicular dimension in half (or to any
      percentage specified as an argument), leaving the particular edge fixed.
      This allows both rapid expansion and contraction of frames with just 4
      keys whenever needed.

      It is easiest to understand by simply trying the keys. See "Demo#Frame
      Commands" for example use.

    - {c} for frame edge location cycling now is available in HyControl
      Windows mode.

    - {p <num>} displays a virtual numeric keypad and moves the selected frame
      to the screen edge position based on the numeric keypad layout, e.g. 3
      moves it to the southeast corner of the screen.  This is for keyboards
      that do not have a physical numeric keypad.  Before a number is
      selected, {C-g} or {q} will exit and return to the top-level of the
      active HyControl mode.

    - {-} in HyControl Windows mode minimizes a window size while trying to
      display its entire buffer.  Now it will resize the window to 1 line if
      it cannot display all lines or if all lines are already displayed.

    - Minibuffer Help: Improved help strings shown in the minibuffer while
      HyControl is active.  Added {?} key which toggles this display on and
      off.
      
    - ESC: Removed this as a quit key since now that regular key sequences are
      supported, this is often used as a meta key prefix.  Use {q} to quit.

    - Minibuffer Prompts: Automatically quit from any HyControl mode whenever
      a minibuffer prompt becomes active so that arguments may be typed
      normally.  Examples include use of {M-:} for Lisp expression evaluation
      and M-x for entering commands by name.

  HYROLO

    - Google Contacts: New support for searching your Google Contacts with the
      HyRolo Contact Manager; for advanced users only.  Requires use of the
      Emacs google-contacts package and the non-Emacs gpg public key package
      to support Google services authorization.  Once configured, these
      contacts are automatically searched together with local HyRolo files any
      time a contact search is performed.  See the Google Contacts part in
      "(hyperbole)HyRolo Settings".

    - Dynamic HyRolo List: The HyRolo list of files to search is now computed
      dynamically so you can enable Big Brother Database (BBDB) or Google
      Contacts support after HyRolo is initialized and these contacts will also
      be searched.

  KEYS

    - Unshifted Mouse Keys: By default, Hyperbole mouse keys are Shift-Middle
      (Action Key) and Shift-Right (Assist Key).  For frequent mouse users,
      there is now {M-x hmouse-add-unshifted-smart-keys RET} which
      additionally makes the Middle mouse key the Action Key and the Right
      mouse key the Assist Key, replacing their default Emacs functions.  {M-x
      hmouse-toggle-bindings RET} will toggle between the Emacs and Hyperbole
      mouse bindings.

    - Smart Key Reload: If you ever edit any of the Smart Key contexts or
      actions in "hui-mouse.el", "hui-window.el", "hibtypes.el" or
      "hactypes.el" and re-byte-compile those files, then you may reload your
      new settings with {M-x hmouse-update-smart-keys RET}.  No need to reload
      or restart Hyperbole.

    - Jump Thing: Added Jump Thing key binding entry to Hyperbole menus.  This
      key jumps between the start and end of a matching delimiter or tag pair.

    - Mod Mouse Keys: Disallowed this feature meant to enable one hand on the
      keyboard while the other hand pressed the mouse keys as Control and Meta
      modifier keys.  Use would conflict with Emacs bindings of Control and
      Meta mouse keys.

  KOUTLINER

    - `e' Viewspec: Removed ellipses viewspec because ellipses can no longer
      be turned off with modern Emacs outlining.

  MENUS

    - Prefix Arguments: Prefix arguments may now be given to any Hyperbole
      menu command that accepts them.

    - Action Doc Strings: If a menu item has no help string but its action is
      a function with a doc string, then that doc string will be used to
      display help for the menu item.

    - Key Bindings: The pulldown menu, Hyperbole/Options/Change-Key-Bindings
      now displays the current keys bound to each command for easy reference.

===========================================================================
*				    V6.0.2
===========================================================================

  BUTTONS

    - pathname Implicit Button Type: generalized to handle hash-style links to
      HTML files, to Github Markdown # sections and to Emacs outline *
      sections.  So an Action Key press on any of the following links displays
      the link referent:
            "man/hyperbole.html#Questions-and-Answers"
	    "README.md#why-was-hyperbole-developed"
	    "DEMO#HTML Markdown and Emacs Outline Hash Links"
      Even links split across 2 lines like this now work: "DEMO#Social Media
      Hashtags and Usernames", as long as point is on the first line.

      Within HTML and Markdown files, in-file hash links without any file name
      prefix work as well.

      HTML hash-links are case-sensitive; other hash-links are not.  Hash links
      typically use dashes in place of the spaces that referents may contain,
      but if the link is enclosed in quotes, Hyperbole allows spaces to be used
      as well.  In fact, it is best practice to always enclose hash-style links
      in quotes so Hyperbole can distinguish them from other similar looking
      constructs, such as social media hashtags (see "(hyperbole)Social Media").

      Pathnames surrounded by literal non-ASCII quote marks now work as well.
      For example, ‘http://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hyperbole/’.

    - New Implicit Button Type, markdown-internal-link, displays any in-file
      Markdown link referent, aside from pathnames and urls.  Together with
      other types, all Markdown links can now be followed by the Action Key.

    - social-reference Implicit Button Type: Disabled this type within quoted
      strings (all modes) and within parentheses (markdown-mode), so in-file
      hash link references are not matched as social hash tags.  Made the list
      of modes a variable, hibtypes-social-inhibit-modes.

    - New link-to-web-search Action Type: Allows global and explicit buttons
      to link to specific web term searches from `hyperbole-web-search-alist'.

    - org-mode Implicit Button Type: Improved to invoke org-meta-return when
      not on an Org link or outline heading.

  DOCUMENTATION

    - Added pointer to HyControl video and {C-c \} binding which invokes
      HyControl window control.

    - README File: New Org-mode user testimonial.

    - DEMO File: Added description and exercise using the new Find/Web menu.

    - Added README.md.html introduction with images combining README, INSTALL
      and HY-ABOUT information.

    - Full set of hand-written changes are now in the file "Changes".  The
      former name, ChangeLog, is now auto-generated from the version controlled
      'git log' but not as complete.

  KEYS

    - New variables, action-key-eol-function and assist-key-eol-function, used
      to control what the Action and Assist Keys do at the end of a line.
      Default behaviors remain as before but now one can set these to do
      something other than scrolling, if desired.  See "(hyperbole)Smart Key -
      Smart Scrolling"

    - When in HyControl, pressing {ESC} now quits in addition to {q}.

  MENUS

    - New submenu, Find/Web, for quick access to major web search engines.
      The Find/Web menu looks like this:
        Web> Amazon Bing Dictionary Elisp Facebook Google Hub(git) Images Maps RFCs StackOverflow Twitter Wikipedia Youtube

      Hyperbole binds the key {C-c /} for quick access to this menu, if it is
      not already bound prior to Hyperbole's initialization. The
      Cust/Web-Search menu, {C-h h c w}, sets the option,
      hyperbole-web-search-browser-function, which determines whether web
      search results are displayed within Emacs or with an external web
      browser.  A short video introduction to the Find/Web menu may be found at
      https://youtu.be/8lMlJed0-OM.

      Advanced users can change the search engines listed in the Find/Web menu
      with M-x customize-variable RET hyperbole-web-search-alist RET.  Changes
      are automatically reflected in the Hyperbole menus once applied.
      Remember each search engine name must begin with a unique letter and each
      URL must have a %s format field indicating where to place the web search
      term when a search is performed.  See "(hyperbole)Web Search Engines".

===========================================================================
*				    V6.0.1
===========================================================================

NOTE: Version 6.0.1 is the first public release by the author since version
4.18.  All version 5 releases were test releases, so all V5 and V6 features
are new in 2016 and you should look through them all.

  BUTTONS

    - New Implicit Button Type, social-reference: for social media hashtag or
      username references, social-reference.  Action key activation
      displays the web page associated with the hashtag or username.
      References can look like #hashtag or @username for Twitter
      references.  fb#hashtag or facebook@username for Facebook references
      or in#hashtag or instagram@username for Instagram references.  See
      the new file "hib-social.el" for more information.

  DOCUMENTATION

    - The introductory parts of the manual have been improved and the flow
      from section to section is better.  Added menu key sequences to
      "(hyperbole)Suggestion or Bug Reporting".  Expanded and added
      instructions on using the customize interface to change the functions
      run by Smart Key modeline clicks.  See "(hyperbole)Smart Key Modeline".

  VARIABLES

    - hsettings.el is now included in the Hyperbole package rather than
      generated (formerly called hsite.el).  Use the Hyperbole customization
      variables to change anything in there rather than editing the file
      manually as before.

===========================================================================
*				    V6.0.0
===========================================================================

  HYROLO

    - The Hyperbole contact manager has been renamed to HyRolo and all of its
      identifiers now begin with hyrolo-.  If you had a custom value of
      `rolo-file-list' in your ~/.emacs file, you should rename it to
      `hyrolo-file-list'.

  KEYS

    - Removed the {RET} key bindings of the Action Key in read-only modes since
      it was not consistent across all modes and probably was little used.  It
      also could interfere with mode-specific usage of this key.  Just use the
      standard Action Key bindings.

  MAIL

    - Implicit mail address buttons are recognized in many more programming
      modes.  See the value of `mail-address-mode-list'.

  VARIABLES

    - Hyperbole is now integrated with the Emacs option customization system,
      allowing for interactive editing and permanent setting of many Hyperbole
      options.  Use {M-x customize-browse RET} and find the Hyperbole group
      under Applications.  Hyperbole's options are divided into logical
      subgroups such as Rolo and Koutliner.  See "(emacs)Easy Customization"
      for details on the customization system and "(hyperbole)Customization"
      for Hyperbole specifics.

    - Renamed any Hyperbole hook variables that had a colon in their names
      to use a hyphen instead.

  WINDOW CONFIGURATIONS

    - Similarly, the commands from the Win/ menu from Wconfig have been
      renamed to begin with hywconfig- and the library is now called
      hywconfig.el.

===========================================================================
*				    V5.15
===========================================================================

  BUTTONS

    - New Implicit Button Type, debbugs-gnu-mode: When on a GNU Debbugs listing
      entry in debbugs-gnu-mode, an Action Key press displays the discussion of
      the selected issue; an Assist Key press pretty prints the status of the
      issue to a window below the listing window.  This augments the
      debbugs-gnu-query implicit button type from V5.14 which recognizes
      bug/issue ids and queries in any buffer.

    - Initial Org Mode Support: The new implicit button type, org-mode, follows
      Org mode hyperlinks and cycles display views of Org mode outline headings.
      When on a heading, the Action Key cycles the view of the subtree at point
      and the Assist Key cycles the view of all headings in the buffer.

      Suggest other good ideas for Smart Key actions on Org entities and we'll
      likely implement them.

    - Links to Info Manual Index Items: You can now drag between windows with
      the Action Mouse Key depressed to an Info Manual index menu entry to
      create an explicit button link to it (or use {C-h h e c} with an action
      type of link-to-Info-index-item).  Then the button will always take you
      to the line in the manual referenced by that index item.  This also works
      with other Info menu items and cross-references.  Implicit buttons that
      reference index items work too, like "(hyperbole)C-c C-m"!  And when you
      are creating the link, full completion of the file name (within
      parentheses) and the index item name is provided; just type ? to list
      completions after typing a few characters.  Since Emacs and most GNU
      programs include Info manuals, you now ​have ​a simple way to link to and
​      ​jump​ ​to any marked item within any manual.
      
      Previously, when creating a link to an Info manual node, Hyperbole
      would ignore cross-references and menu items and just link directly
      to the node rather than anything it referenced.  To get that behavior
      now, simply link to a place in the node that does not reference another
      place.

    - Link Button Creation: Hyperbole now shows you what you linked to at
      global or explicit link button creation time.  Previously, it showed you
      only the type of the link.  So if you drag across windows from a button
      label to an Info index item now, you will know that the link goes to the
      index item entry and not to the index node containing the item reference.

    - New Implicit Button Type, pathname-line-and-column: A whitespace or quote
      delimited existing pathname followed by a :line-num and an optional
      :column-num displays the path at line-num and column-num.  So
      "~/.emacs:10:40" shows your Emacs initialization file at line 10 and
      column 40.  The column number is optional.​

    - GNU Info Manual Key Sequences: Previously, Hyperbole recognized​ ​key
      sequences delimited by curly braces only, {}.  Now it recognizes​ the​
      ​quotation ​marks used in GNU Info manuals as well and can execute them
      with an Action Key press within Info buffers.

    - Imenu Item Recognition: When the Emacs imenu library is in use and an
      identifier menu has been generated for the current buffer, an Action Key
      press on an identifier at point jumps to the identifier definition
      within the current buffer; an Assist Key press prompts with completion
      for an identifier defined within the buffer and then jumps to its
      definition.

  DOCUMENTATION

    - Smart Key Debugging: Added a section, "(hyperbole)Smart Key Debugging",
      to the Hyperbole Manual, documenting the usage of the Customize Menu
      option, Toggle-Smart-Key-Debug (minibuffer menu Cust/Debug-Toggle,
      {C-h h c d}).

  KEYS

    - Toggle Hyperbole Keys: The new command, {M-x hyperbole-toggle-bindings
      RET}, toggles Hyperbole mouse and keyboard keys off and on.  This is not
      bound to a key because it will make Hyperbole unusable until the keys are
      re-established with another toggle.  This forces you to know what you are
      doing before you utilize this feature.

  MENUS

    - Minibuffer Keyboard Direct Selection:  You have always been able to click
      with your mouse on a minibuffer menu item to directly select it.  Now
      Hyperbole has the keys {TAB} or {M-f} to move to the next menu item and
      {Shift-TAB}, {M-TAB} or {M-b} to move to the previous item, with each
      cycling back when it reaches the end or beginning of the menu.  The
      fastest way to select minibuffer menu items from the keyboard remains
      typing the first letter (case-insensitive) of the menu item.

    - Minibuffer Menu Navigation Changes: A press of {RET} with point at the
      end of a menu, quits from the menu.  {RET} with point in a menu prefix
      (before the '>' character), returns to the top-level Hyperbole menu.
      Clicks of the Action Mouse Key do the same thing, so now you can
      navigate and quit from menus with just the Action Mouse Key.

===========================================================================
*  			        V5.13 and V5.14
===========================================================================

  BUTTONS

    - Instant Bug Lookups and Queries: New Gnu Debbugs bug/issue tracking
      implicit button type, debbugs-gnu-query, that jumps to the description
      and discussion of issues by issue number and displays an issue's status.
      This works for the GNU Hyperbole issue tracker as well as many other GNU
      projects.  All of these button formats may be embedded within any text:

	     #id-number
	     bug#id-number, bug# id-number, bug #id-number or bug id-number
	     bug?attr1=val1&attr2=val2&attr3=val3
	     bug#id-number?attr1=val1&attr2=val2&attr3=val3

      Note that `issue' or `debbugs' may be used in place of `bug'.

      See the documentation at the start of "hib-debbugs.el" for more
      information.

    - During the creation of link-to-Info-node explicit buttons with an
      argument of the type (filename)nodename, full completion is offered for
      both the filename and the node name; just type ? to list completions
      after typing a few characters.  You now can drop the .info suffix from
      filenames as well, so "(hyperbole)Smart Keys" works fine as a node
      reference.

    - Implicit links from the output of the UNIX apropos command now work
      properly in Emacs 25.

    - Implicit pathname matches now handle compressed Emacs Lisp files found
      anywhere within the directories of `load-path' and do not try to expand
      paths that begin with a ~.

    - New variable, `hpath:info-suffix', is a regular expression of Info
      filename suffixes which may be omitted when using parenthesized Info
      filenames in links; this allows for compressed Info file matches and Info
      pathnames of the form "(Hyperbole)" to work.  That displays the top node
      of the Hyperbole Manual in the Info browser.

    - Pathnames ending in .mp3, .wav or .ogg are played as music files rather
      than displayed if your Emacs has support for this.  Modify the value of
      the variable, `hpath:internal-display-alist' to add more formats.

    - New per-window system association list variables determine what if any
      file types within Hyperbole hyperlinks are displayed by external programs
      outside of Emacs.  See the values of and documentation for:
      `hpath:external-display-alist-macos', `hpath:external-display-alist-mswindows',
      and `hpath:external-display-alist-x'.

    - Added support for &, ~, and ^ as identifier characters in Lisp tags and
      removed #.

  DOCUMENTATION

    - DEMO File: Major updates to reflect the latest Hyperbole features.  Added
      sections on HyControl, Creating and Modifying Explicit Buttons and
      Path Suffixes and Variables.  Try it out with {C-h h d d}.

    - Hyperbole Manual
        - Updated all screenshots in the manual; thanks to Mats L.
        - In the "(hyperbole)Internal Viewers" section, added a description of
          the file formats supported by the default setting of the
          `hpath:internal-display-alist' variable.
        - Added sections "(hyperbole)Smart Key Modifiers" and
	  "(hyperbole)Smart Key Modeline".
        - Added a "(hyperbole)Glossary" entry for Chord Keyboard.
        - In "(hyperbole)Smart Key Thing Selection", added documentation of the
          {C-c RET} key for syntactical region marking and the {C-c .} key for
          delimited thing jumping between start and end.
        - In the Cust/ menu section of "(hyperbole)Menus" which lists all
	  Hyperbole key bindings, indicated which keys are bound only if not
	  bound prior to loading Hyperbole.

  HYCONTROL

    - Frame placement calculations now account for window system decorations
      around frame, leading to improved placement offsets around screen edges.
      See the documentation for `hycontrol-set-screen-offsets'.

  MENUS

    - On the Hyperbole menubar menu, the Types submenu which shows
      documentation for Hyperbole types has been moved below the Documentation
      menu to match the Hyperbole minibuffer menu location.  Also added a Types
      menu item under the Explicit-Button menu to match the one under the
      Implicit-Button menu.

    - On the Hyperbole Customize/Change-Key-Bindings menubar menu, renamed
      these entries and added Mark-Thing-Key.  Similar updates done to the
      minibuffer menu.

  MOUSE AND SMART KEY SUPPORT

    - An Action Key press on a Hyperbole minibuffer menu key sequence now
      invokes the associated menu action.  Try it with {C-h h d g} to see the
      Hyperbole glossary.  An Assist Key press shows help for the menu item.

    - Changed the `assist-key-default-function' which applies in an unrecognized
      context to trigger an error by default to match the behavior of the
      Action Key.  Its prior value, toggle display of or hide the Smart Key
      summary, is performed by an Assist Key click in the right of a modeline
      or via minibuffer menu with {C-h h d s}.

    - Point is now left within the Smart Key summary by default and it is in
      help mode so you can page through it with SPC and DEL keys and then quit
      from it with {q}.

    - A click of the Action Mouse Key within an inactive minibuffer window
      displays the Hyperbole minibuffer menu, allowing you to invoke menu
      entries with the mouse.  A click of the Assist Key in the same place
      displays the buffer, window and frame jump menu just as does a click
      within the middle of a modeline since it is easy to miss by a little and
      click on one or the other.  These behaviors are controlled by the new
      variables, `action-key-minibuffer-function' and
      `assist-key-minibuffer-function'.

    - Distributed Window System Support: Previously, Hyperbole supported mouse
      control only on the screen on which it was launched.  If you used
      emacsclient or other means to create a frame on another screen or outside
      of a terminal, that frame would not have Hyperbole mouse support even
      though it was under a window system.  Now each frame receives mouse
      support whenever its window system has mouse support.

    - Improved support for using the Action and Assist Mouse Keys as Control-
      and Meta- modifier keys, mainly for use with a chord keyboard or to
      balance hand use to reduce carpal tunnel stress.  Made `hmouse-mod-mode'
      a regular minor mode.  See "(hyperbole)Smart Key Modifiers" for more
      details.

  ROLO

    - Fixed entry sorting to work with Emacs 25.


===========================================================================
*				    V5.12
===========================================================================

  BUTTONS

    - Prevented keyword matches as identifiers in Java, C++, C, Objective-C
      and Python. 

    - Prevented @ annotation matches when matching to Java identifiers/tags.

    - In Info documentation browsing mode, added support for index nodes and
      for fixed header line and text-property-based breadcrumb header lines
      now used in Emacs, so the Action Key can now follow links associated
      with all of these entities.

    - In compilation buffers, e.g. {M-x make RET}, if an error line has a
      relative pathname which Hyperbole cannot resolve, it will prompt
      for the directory in which to resolve the path.

  DOCUMENTATION

    - Added printable hyperbole.pdf version of the Hyperbole Manual.

    - DEMO file: Updated horizontal and vertical drag exercises to
      correspond to current Hyperbole behavior.

    - Added chapter on HyControl, window, frame and buffer control.

    - In the Hyperbole Manual Glossary, added Buffer, Frame, HyControl
      and Window definitions. 

    - Added additional Q&A in an appendix.

    - Clarified and fixed Smart Key modeline behavior documentation.

    - Made example text larger for easier reading.

    - Added Screen definition to the Glossary.

  EMACS SUPPORT

    - Hyperbole now includes the fastest, easiest-to-use Emacs window and frame
      management system available; we call it HyControl.  If you use a lot of
      Emacs windows or frames (typically, window system windows), this is for
      you.  HyControl lets you interactively adjust the current layout of your
      windows and frames down to the pixel-level if desired.  You keep
      adjusting the location, size and display elements of your windows and
      frames until they look as you like and then you simply quit HyControl and
      go back to work.

    - Expanded Hyperbole menu of buffers by major mode to allow for
      `hui-menu-max-list-length' number of buffers, by default, 24.

    - Made a right to left horizontal drag from near a right-side window divider
      properly shrink the window width under Emacs 25.

  KEYS

    - The Hyperbole Screen submenu provides access to HyControl as well as the
      key binding {C-c \}.

    - Removed {C-c C-t} hmouse-toggle-bindings key binding.  This
      should be used rarely, so force use of {M-x hmouse-toggle-bindings RET). 

    - Updated "hmouse-mod.el" library for Emacs 25; it allows using the Smart
      Mouse Keys as Control and Meta modifiers when desired.

  KOUTLINER

    - Improved recognition of Klinks, preventing false matches.

    - Added missing {C-c C-i}/{C-c TAB} binding mentioned in the EXAMPLE.kotl
      file; sets cell attributes.

    - {C-t} Transpose characters - Added error checks at the beginning of cells
      and end of lines for times when there are not 2 chars to transpose.

  ROLO
  
    - Improved {M-s} interactive string searching for rolo match buffer strings.
      Made {C-u M-s} do a regexp search for rolo match buffer strings.

    - Documented the {l} hyrolo-locate command in the Hyperbole manual.

    - The format of the rolo entry date added to new entries is now configurable
      via the variable, `hyrolo-date-format'.  It uses the formatting
      strings listed in the documentation of the function `format-time-string'.

    - All rolo find and search commands are now case-insensitive.

    - Using a numeric prefix argument with rolo find commands now
      properly limits the number of matches to a maximum of that number.

    - If the Big Brother Database (BBDB) is loaded before the rolo, its
      `bbdb-file' is added to the list of files searched by the rolo.
      You can manually added this file to `hyrolo-file-list' as well and
      its format will automatically be handled by the rolo.

===========================================================================
*				    V5.11
===========================================================================

  BUTTONS

    - Improved support for remote pathname access (outside local
      filesystems).

  EMACS SUPPORT

    - Much faster and better lookup of active Emacs Lisp identifiers
      when the Action Key is pressed over one.  Face definitions are
      also found now.  TAGS files are used only if the identifier has
      not been loaded within the current Emacs session.

  KOUTLINER

    - Proper support for isearch temporary display of invisible text
      when it contains a search match.  {C-s}, interactive search,
      expands and contracts text dynamically to show any search
      results, just as it does in the regular Emacs outline mode.  You
      can toggle whether such searches include invisible/hidden text
      (the default) or not.  Use the
      Customize/Toggle-Isearch-Invisible-Text menubar item or the
      Cust/Isearch-Invisible minibuffer menu item to toggle this
      setting.

  MAIL AND NEWS READERS

    - New variable, `inhibit-hyperbole-messaging' with default value
      of t inhibits Hyperbole's support for explicit buttons within
      mail and news buffers.  When t, Hyperbole will not alter
      messaging mode hooks nor overload functions from these packages,
      preventing potential incompatibilities.

      If you want to use Hyperbole buttons in mail and news buffers,
      use the new Customize/Toggle-Messaging-Explicit-Buttons menubar
      item or the minibuffer menu Cust/Msg-Toggle-Ebuts item.  These
      not only change the variable value but also add or remove the
      setup hooks as necessary.

  ROLO
  
    - New {o} key binding for an overview of all Rolo matches at all
      levels, one line per entry.

    - {t} top-level cells command works in all cases now.

    - {Shift-TAB} added as an additional key to move backwards one
      Rolo match.

    - Improved operation of {l} and {M-s C-s} commands that search for
      occurrences of match strings and allow extending the search term.

    - Support for looking up contacts in the Big Brother Database
      (BBDB) file of email addresses, when that package is used.
      The functions, hyrolo-grep-bbdb finds regular expression matches
      and hyrolo-fgrep-bbdb finds string matches.  All regular Rolo
      match buffer commands may then be applied. The {e} command for
      editing an entry signals an error when applied to the BBDB file,
      however.

  SMART KEYS

    - The Assist Key when pressed in the middle portion of a modeline
      now pops up a very useful menu of display-oriented commands.
      Jump to buffers categorized by major mode, to windows by buffer
      name, or to frames by name.  Manage your windows and frames
      quickly with this menu as well.  Another can't live without
      feature.  This comes from the new file, hui-jmenu.el.

    - Added Python etags support for jumping to Python definitions.
      With the separate OO-Browser package, definition location is
      much better than just with etags.
      See "(hyperbole)Smart Key - Python Source Code" for help.

    - The Hyperbole Manual Smart Key Reference appendix now has a
      subsection for each context, allowing quick reference of a
      particular Smart Key context.  Also, added documentation for
      delimited thing selection, copying and moving.

    - New function, hyperbole-popup-menu, to display the Hyperbole
      menubar menu at the mouse point (or the left of the menubar when
      running on a dumb terminal).  This is useful as a setting
      of `action-key-default-function' if you want some undefined
      Action Key context to popup this menu in order to use Hyperbole
      commands.

===========================================================================
*				    V5.10
===========================================================================

  EMACS SUPPORT

    - Hyperbole now downloads, builds and installs as a regular
      Emacs package (but from a special archive location while pre-testing).

    - Automatic time-zone handling under MS Windows (already existed
      for UNIX-like operating systems).  Plus support for 3 mouse
      buttons under Windows.

  IMPLICIT BUTTON TYPES

    - Updated the extended find-file commands which handle http (www) and ftp
      URLs to support the Tramp library included with newer versions of Emacs.
      Use the menu item Hyperbole/Customization/Find-File-Accepts-URLs to
      enable or to disable this.  See "(hyperbole)Using URLs with Find-File"
      for details.

  KOUTLINER

    - Editing commands that normally delete/replace an active region
      now do this in the Koutline.  If a region extends beyond one
      cell, an error is triggered or if `kotl-mode:shrink-region-flag'
      is set to t, the Koutliner automatically shrinks the region to
      the first cell within the region and then continues the editing
      operation.

    - Updated yanking and other editing commands for improved
      compatibility with Emacs 25.

    - Internal improvements to many tree handling, filling and view
      changing commands.

    - New Shift-TAB key binding to demote trees (shift them up a
      level), for compatibility with other outliners.

  MENUS

    - The new Find/Locate-Files menu item (minibuffer menu
      Find/LocateFiles) prompts for a pattern and displays a list of
      all matching pathnames found throughout the file system.  On Mac
      OS X, this uses Spotlight (the mdfind command); on UNIX, it uses
      the `locate' command.  Within the result *Locate* buffer, you
      can then use the Find/Grep-Files menu item to find matching
      lines within only these paths (files and directories).

  SMART KEYS

    - Action Key now ignores JavaScript keywords when searching for
      identifiers to match.

    - Commands that interactively prompt for a Koutline cell label now
      offer completion and require a match to a visible outline cell.
      This helps prevent operating on an invisible cell unintentionally.

  THING SELECTION

    - Selection of open/close matched tag pairs and jumping between
      them now works in web-mode, which supports multiple web
      languages within one file (previously only html-mode was
      supported).  Also, can now select chained identifiers like:
      parent.child.subchild in html and web modes with the {C-c
      RETURN} thing selection key.

    - Can now select comments when at a comment start; try it with
      the Action Key.

    - Can now select Lisp symbols with colons in them within help
      buffers since they often appear there.

  VARIABLES

    - hyperb:init-hook renamed to hyperbole-init-hook, a more standard name.
      See the GNU Hyperbole Manual for its usage.

===========================================================================
*				    V5.09
===========================================================================

  FRAMES

    - The Window-Configuration menu (minibuffer Win/ menu) now stores and
      restores frame-specific window configurations, allowing each frame to be
      dedicated to different types of work or groups of buffers.

  INSTALLATION

    - Hyperbole initialization is greatly simplified.  A single "~/.emacs"
      line of the form:

        (require 'hyperbole (expand-file-name "hyperbole" "<HYPERBOLE-DIR>/")

      loads and initializes Hyperbole.  Please change your site-wide or
      personal initialization to this.  (No more setting of hyperb:dir and
      load-path nor copying of hsite-ex.el to hsite.el is required; Hyperbole
      does this for you).

  KEYS

    - A new Customize Menu option, Toggle-Smart-Key-Debug (minibuffer menu
      Cust/Debug-Toggle, {C-h h c d}), displays a message in the minibuffer
      every time the Action Key or Assist Key is pressed, showing the context
      of the press and its associated action, allowing you to easily see
      what is happening whenever you use a Smart Key.

      These messages are all prefaced with "(HyDebug)" and are accumulated in
      the *Messages* buffer for later viewing.

    - Smart Keys work in any completion buffer now, e.g. the ido.el completion
      buffer.

    - Horizontal and vertical mouse drags within a single window, that do not
      begin on a thing delimiter, are now simpler and more consistent.  An
      Action Key drag splits the window either below (horizontal drag) or
      side-by-side (vertical drag).  An Assist Key drag deletes the window.

    - Hyperbole no longer uses the right mouse button, so it is free for popup menus.
      The Assist Mouse Key is always on the Shift-Right mouse button as well as
      on a C-u prefix to the Action Mouse Key.

    - A new setting, `hmouse-middle-flag', when set to t (true) before Hyperbole
      is loaded adds the middle mouse key as an Action Key.  InfoDock does this
      by default.

    - ibuffer-mode, the dired-like menu listing for buffers, is now supported
      by the Smart Keys; it behaves similarly to that of Buffer-menu-mode.

    - Xref item listing mode is now supported by the Smart Keys; The Action
      Key displays an xref file line or just a file containing an xref.
      The Assist Key displays the same but leaves point in the listing buffer.
      Xref is a built-in Emacs package that displays definitions and
      cross-references of identifier strings.  It is similar to etags, but
      more general. 

  KOUTLINER

    - Now compatible with the latest version of outline.el (using invisible overlays).

    - All menus for the Hyperbole auto-numbered outliner, called the Koutliner,
      now begin with 'K'.  Some used to start with 'O'.  To edit the example
      Koutline, use {C-h h k e}.

    - {C-c C-a}  - Show-all, expand all cells in the current view.
      {C-c C-o}  - Overview, show only first line of outline cells.
      {C-c C-t}  - Top-level, hide all cells below level 1 and show
                   only the first line of each level 1 cell.

      By default, these commands no longer affect the display of blank lines
      between cells.  But if given a prefix argument, they toggle blank
      lines display for quick view changes.

    - Values of `user-mail-address' or `message-user-fqdn' are now
      used to set the creator and modifier names in Koutline cells.

  MAIL LISTS

    - The menu item that composes mail to the bug-hyperbole mail list now
      includes any (HyDebug) messages output when the Hyperbole configuration
      option, hkey-debug is enabled (via the Customize Menu or via
      {C-h h c d}).


===========================================================================
*				    V5.08
===========================================================================

  DOCUMENTATION

    - Added web version of the Hyperbole Manual.

  HYPERLINKS

    - Action Key presses on Texinfo menu items and @node item references now
      display the associated Texinfo node.  @code and @var references to Emacs
      Lisp identifiers now show the documentation for the identifiers.  As
      before, cross-references and file includes show the referenced items;
      keyboard key sequences invoke their associated bindings.

    - Action Key press on an Emacs push button activates the button.  An Assist
      Key press shows help for the button.

  KEYS

    - Delimited things, including lists, comments, strings, arrays/vectors,
      sets, functions and markup pair tags (e.g. <div> </div>), may now be
      selected, copied or moved with the Action and Assist mouse and keyboard
      keys whenever point is on the first character of the starting or ending
      delimiter.  For strings and comments, point must be on the first line.

    - New {C-c .} binding that jumps between the start and end delimiters of
      delimited things.  Try it on matching markup tag pairs in HTML and SGML
      modes.  If point is not immediately before or after a delimiter, this
      generally does nothing.

    - New {C-c RET} binding selects bigger and bigger syntactical units within
      a buffer with each successive invocation.  Double clicks of the left
      mouse button do the same thing.  Try it, you'll like it.

===========================================================================
*			            V5.07
===========================================================================

  EMACS VERSIONS

    - Support for the latest pre-releases of Emacs 25 and new versions of
      XEmacs.

  HYPERLINKS

    - URL handling updated along with customization menus to support most
      popular web browsers in use.

    - Action Key on a mailto: URI starts composing mail to that address.

    - When testing file formats/suffixes for an external viewer in
      which to display the file, as a fallback, a MIME system mailcap
      file is used to find additional possible viewers.  See
      "http://www.wikiwand.com/en/Mailcap" for information on mailcap files.

    - Jump to JavaScript identifier definitions.

    - History, {C-h h h}, now restores full multi-window and multi-frame display
      configurations (within a single Emacs session), rather than just returning
      to a prior location in a buffer.

    - Type {q} in a Hyperbole Help buffer hide that buffer and return to your prior
      location.

  KEYS

    - By default, Hyperbole now removes any mode-specific, local key
      bindings that conflict with the global Smart Key bindings
      (typically {Meta-Return}). Use the Customize/Toggle-Override-Local-Keys
      to disable (or re-enable) this feature.

  KOUTLINER

    - When running under InfoDock, its Go and Options menus now appear within
      the Koutliner menu.

    - With a prefix argument, Koutlines are exported to HTML with soft newlines
      rather than hard newlines, so text will flow based on browser window size.
      This option will remove line-by-line formatting within a cell, however.

  MENUS

    - New Find menu which can reduce a buffer to just matching or non-matching
      lines, run the 'grep' or 'fgrep' utilities on a file directory tree, or
      list matching lines in the current buffer or across all buffers with
      attached files.

    - Renamed Customization menu to Customize.

    - New Customize/Change-Key-Bindings menu lets you rebind any Hyperbole
      keys for your current emacs session.


  	         ------- VERY OLD CHANGES BELOW HERE -------

===========================================================================
*				    V4.18
===========================================================================

  ACTION AND ASSIST KEYS

    - Default Action Key action is to signal an error (rather than display
      the Hyperbole minibuffer menu) since it was too easy to confuse new
      users with this behavior.  More skilled users can set
      `action-key-default-function' to do what they would like.

    - Fixed bug that caused proportional scrolling to not be the default when 
      the Action Key is pressed at the end of a line.

  KOUTLINER

    - Fixed filling behavior when used with the `filladapt' package under
      InfoDock.

    - Improved text file importation process.

===========================================================================
*				    V4.17
===========================================================================

  IMPLICIT BUTTON TYPES

    - The Action Key now recognizes existing local files without any
      delimiters (aside from whitespace).  This allows you to display files
      from directory listings or virtually anywhere within documents.
      Relative pathnames are resolved relative to the directory associated
      with the current buffer.

    - Extended find-file commands to handle http (www) and ftp URLs
      if the efs package is available and the
      Hyperbole/Customization/Find-File-Accepts-URLs is enabled.
      See "(hyperbole)Using URLs with Find-File" for details.

    - Improved display of special files via external viewers.

    - Added support for jumping to the source of errors from the Weblint Perl
      package.

    - The `make' error implicit button type now accounts for movement from
      one directory to another within make output so that the right source
      file is selected.

  CONTACT MANAGER

    - Default personal rolo file renamed to "~/.rolo.otl" ("C:_rolo.otl" on
      Windows).  When the contact manager is loaded, it will automatically
      prompt you to rename this file when necessary.  You should rename it
      but if you choose not to the old rolo file will be searched.

    - Added `rolo-display-format-function' which can be used to customize the
      display of rolo search matches.  See the Info manual section,
      "(hyperbole)HyRolo Settings" for details. 

  KOUTLINER

    - Fixed interaction problem with the standard editor autofilling
      functions.

===========================================================================
*				    V4.16
===========================================================================

  This release fixes a number of small issues with tags table handling under
  GNU Emacs and Koutline export to HTML.

  ACTION AND ASSIST KEYS

    - Added support for selection of function names from a buffer in
      fume-list-mode created by the func-menu.el package.

===========================================================================
*				    V4.15
===========================================================================

  ACTION AND ASSIST KEYS

    - Added support for the pop-tag-mark command {M-*} available in some
      editors to move back to prior code locations displayed from clicking
      the Action Key on an identifier or other cross-reference.  {C-u M-*}
      moves forward (instead of back) through this location history list.

    - Added support for multiple TAGS file searches when looking for an
      identifier definition from an Action Key click.  Each TAG file found in 
      an ancestor directory of the current directory is searched until an
      exact match is found (otherwise, an error message is displayed).
      This works only under newer editors whose tag support includes multiple
      tag file searching.

    - Added support for Action Key clicks on identifiers displayed in
      `help-mode' by the emacs Lisp variable and function documentation
      command under newer editor versions.

    - On case-insensitive OSes, automatically load OO-Browser Environment
      files named `oobr' instead of `OOBR'.

===========================================================================
*				 V4.11-4.14
===========================================================================

  CONTACT MANAGER

    - Support for editing entries found from logical expression queries.

  EMACS VERSIONS

    - Support for XEmacs version 20 and above.

    - Support for NT Emacs and XEmacs on NT.

  KOUTLINER

    - New Demote, Promote, Tab-Key-Inserts-Spaces and Tab-Key-Tabs-Over
      items added to the Edit menu.

    - Hyperbole/Koutliner menu items are now deactivated when the
      current buffer is not a Koutline.

    - Meta-Backspace under XEmacs now does the right thing (deletes a word
      backwards by default).

  HYPERLINKS

    - An entry in (hpath:get-external-display-alist) used to externally display
      special file types may now contain a list of executables, the first of 
      which is found on a system is used to do the display.  The executable
      to use is recomputed each time a file is displayed to account for any
      changes in executables found in the search path.

    - Abbreviated URLs of the form www.domain.com are now properly
      recognized (there was a bug in earlier versions).

    - Added support for CRLF line endings used under Microsoft OSes.

    - Improved button highlighting initialization.

  IMPLICIT BUTTON TYPES

    - New type, gnus-push-button, for clicking on or pressing buttons
      embedded in GNUS articles, e.g. to collapse and expand signatures.

    - Improved debugger stack backtrace recognition and source line jumping.

    - MANIFEST.suffix files are now recognized and treated like files named
      MANIFEST (allowing you to browse the contents by pressing the Action
      on entries within the file).

    - URL browsing now uses the `browse-url-browser-function' variable to
      determine which web browser to invoke.  The menus have been converted
      to use this variable as well.  Hyperbole will automatically read
      old settings of `action-key-url-function' and convert to this new
      standard.

      Additionally the Grail (Python-based) and Lynx (text-based) browsers
      have been added to the Customization menu.

    - Added initial point-and-click Python support.

  MOUSE SUPPORT

    - Better support for 2-button mice.

===========================================================================
*				    V4.10
===========================================================================

  ACTION AND ASSIST KEYS

    - When a region is active within your editor, the Action Mouse Key pastes
      the region within the window where it is clicked.

    - Better handling of selection of C++ `operator' methods.

    - An Action Key press on an entry in an OO-Browser OOBR-FTR feature tag
      file jumps to the definition of the entry within the source code.

    - Greatly improved selection of minibuffer arguments from completion
      buffers with the Action Key.

    - An Action Key click on any filename with OOBR (case-sensitive) within
      its name will now load the file as an OO-Browser Environment and
      display its classes within the OO-Browser.  (This used to work only for
      Files whose exact name was OOBR or OOBR-FTR.)

    - An Action Key press on a file whose suffix is .rdb now loads the file
      as an InfoDock RDB in-memory relational database file.  The InfoDock
      RDB package is available separately as part of InfoDock.

    - Added support for sending a URL to another web browser with an Action
      Key click when in a W3 web browser buffer.  Eliminated support for the
      old Mosaic browser.

  IMPLICIT BUTTON TYPES

    - New type, id-cflow, used to browse C code call trees produced by
      InfoDock's "id-cflow.el" module.  See that file for details if you have
      InfoDock.

    - grep-msg type that displays source lines associated with grep messages
      and compiler error messages now supports Microsoft JVC error messages.

    - Improved URL identification, including support for terse URLs that
      contain no protocol prefix, e.g. www.gnu.org.

  CONTACT MANAGER

    - The Rolo/Search-for-String (rolo-fgrep) command can now do logical
      searches using prefix logical expressions surrounded by parentheses:
        (or string1 string2)
	(xor string1 (and string2 string3)) ;; xor is exclusive-or
	(not string1)

    - Accelerated location of the alphabetized insertion point for a new
      contact entry by 3-fold.

  KOUTLINER

    - Koutlines can now be converted to nice looking HTML documents with one
      command, `kexport:html', on the menus as Koutline/Export-to-HTML.
      Relative identifiers, hyperlinks and idstamps are all properly exported
      to the HTML document.  Other cell attributes are not yet exported.

    - Autonumber labels in new outlines are now terminated with a "."
      rather than a space by default to better delimit labels.

    - Added kotl-mode:tab-flag which can allow easy insertion of many tab
      characters and can make the TAB key demote cells only when point is at
      the beginning of the cell.

    - Added support for indenting regions within a cell via the
      kotl-mode:indent-region command.

    - New menu item, Import-to-Koutline, for importing star-delimited
      outlines, other koutlines and Augment-system post-numbered outlines
      (ignore this if you don't know what the Augment system is).

  EMACS VERSIONS

    - Support for GNU Emacs version 20 and above.

  DOCUMENTATION

    - The Hyperbole online manual can now be browsed automatically from
      within the Hyperbole distribution without the need to install it
      separately within the editor.

===========================================================================
*				V4.024-V4.027
===========================================================================

  DOCUMENTATION

    - Rewrote the Hyperbole manual for clarity and ease of reading.  Added
      a number of images.

  ACTION AND ASSIST KEYS

    - Improved recognition of local file URLs.

    - Disabled the {C-c t} key which usually switches between Hyperbole
      and personal mouse settings since this is too easy for novices to
      press and then not know why their mouse keys have changed.

    - Emacs Lisp filenames without any pathname information are
      now properly displayed when the Action Key is depressed over
      them and they are delimited by quotes.

    - Action Key press over .dvi file names now invoke the Xdvi previewer
      by default.

    - Action Key press on Fortran90 identifiers now jump to their
      definitions if a TAGS table has been built.

    - Action Key press in a Texinfo file on an @xref, @pxref or @ref
      keyword displays the associated node within the Texinfo file.  An
      Action Key press within the braces of the cross-reference displays the
      online Info node associated with the cross-reference, if the Info
      manual has already been installed.

    - Image files may be displayed within the editor if the editor supports
      this and image-mode is available.

    - The new variable, mail-address-mode-list, determines the major modes
      in which Action Key presses on <delimited> mail addresses start
      composing mail to that address.

    - Action Key presses on lines in ctags files (tags) or etags files (TAGS)
      jump to either the pathname on the line or the definition of the tag
      on the current line.

    - Eliminated trailing commas from inclusion in URLs sent to a browser.

  KOUTLINER

    - Improved paragraph filling even more under InfoDock.

    - Eliminated local {M-BS} binding if it is already bound
      when the Koutliner is invoked.

    - Added +V interactive reading extension for reading a Koutliner View
      Spec within a Lisp command.

    - Added Label-Type/Set-Label-Separator menu item for changing the
      separator between Koutline cell numbers and their body text.

    - Added an `Example' menu item to the Koutliner menu to simplify
      interactive editing of the EXAMPLE.kotl file.

  BUTTONS

    - Info-directory-list setting is now recognized during
      link-to-Info-node button creations.

  MENUS

    - Added an item to add and remove the Hyperbole Menu from the menubar.

  MAIL READERS

    - Updated VM interface for version 6.19.


===========================================================================
*				   V4.023
===========================================================================

  ACTION AND ASSIST KEYS

    - Action Key clicks on HTTP URLs use the Emacs internal web browser
      if not running under a window system.

  CONTACT MANAGER

    - Date stamps are added to each rolo entry when created and updated
      when edited.  This feature can be toggled on and off with: M-x
      rolo-toggle-datestamps RET, or via the Toggle-Rolo-Dates menu
      item on the Customization menu.

    - wrolo-add-hook is called after a new entry is added.
      wrolo-edit-hook is called after an entry is displayed for editing.

===========================================================================
*				    V4.02
===========================================================================

  ACTION AND ASSIST KEYS

    - Support for new ID-edit mode (a part of InfoDock) that allows rapid,
      cutting, copying and yanking of regions plus fast display management.
      In this mode, the Action and Assist keys yank the previously selected
      region at point.

    - An Action Key press on a Java identifier jumps to its definition
      (if an associated TAGS file or OO-Browser environment exists).  The
      same is true for an `@see' cross-reference within a Java comment.  The
      variable, `smart-java-package-path,' determines where Java
      package source can be found when the OO-Browser is not in use.

    - An Action Key press on a double or single quoted Emacs Lisp filename
      (without any path) displays the file by looking for it among the
      directories in the variable, `load-path'.

    - If the Action Key is pressed on a function identifier that is defined
      in the same buffer as the reference clicked upon, it will now be
      displayed faster, since the func-menu package will be used.  The
      reference identifier will also flash when pressed, if the display
      device supports this.

  EMACS VERSIONS

    - Further support for MS-DOS, Windows NT Emacs, and Win-Emacs.

    - Fixed configuration setup problem when running Emacs on a dumb
      terminal.

  KOUTLINER

    - XEmacs 19.14 and above: Fixed display of current viewspec in the
      modeline to accommodate modeline extents (specialized modeline regions).
      This eliminated an error that occurred when reading in an Koutline file.

    - Fixed bug that prevented installation of Koutliner mode-specific
      menubar when running InfoDock.

  MENUS

    - New Hyperbole/About menu item added.  In minibuffer menus, this item is
      found under the Doc/ menu.

    - New window system menu, Hyperbole/Customization (and minibuffer menu,
      Cust/) added to set Hyperbole options, including where Hyperbole link
      referents are displayed, where URLs are displayed and whether to use
      proportional or windowful scrolling when a Smart Key is pressed at the
      end of a line.

    - The default setting of where Hyperbole link references are displayed
      may be set in "hsite.el" via the variable, `hpath:display-where'
      (after Hyperbole has been installed using `make install').
      See its documentation for detail.

    - The Hyperbole/Global-Button menu now includes a menu item that will
      activate each existing global button.  The Hyperbole/Explicit-Button
      menu does the same thing for explicit buttons in the current buffer.

  CONTACT MANAGER

    - Rolo-edit, bound to {e} in the rolo match buffer, now works properly
      if the rolo is loaded before the rest of the Hyperbole system.


===========================================================================
*			      V4.00 and V4.01
===========================================================================

  ACTION AND ASSIST KEYS

    - New variable, action-key-url-function, sets the function used to
      display URLs which are activated as implicit buttons with the Action
      Key.

    - Action or Assist Key presses at the end of a line now scroll
      proportionally, by default.  See the documentation for the variable,
      smart-scroll-proportional, and the Smart Scrolling section of the
      Hyperbole DEMO file, for more information.

    - Fixed bug that prevented browsing Info files in dired with the Action
      Key.

  BUTTON TYPES

    - "hsys-w3.el" is now automatically loaded so that the Action Key can
      follow URLs by default.  It defines the implicit button type, www-url. 

    - New implicit button type, text-toc, makes table of contents entries in
      README files jump to the associated section of the file.  Try it with
      this file once you have loaded the current version of Hyperbole.

  DOCUMENTATION

    - A lot of work has gone into reorganizing and rewriting the Hyperbole
      manual to improve its readability and completeness.  A full chapter on
      the Koutliner has been added.  Please take some time to read the parts
      of interest to you and send your feedback on what is good and what is
      not to the mail list, <hyperbole@hub.ucsb.edu>.

  EMACS VERSIONS

    - MS-DOS and Windows NT Emacs 19 or Win-Emacs: Made Hyperbole work under
      all of these PC Emacs versions.

    - Emacs 19: Fixed bug that prevented Action Key selection of minibuffer
      menu items.

    - Emacs 19: Hyperbole menubar menus are now properly displayed.

    - Emacs 19: Action Key press on a filename that has a .info suffix
      displays the Top node for that info file in the Info browser.

  KOUTLINER

    - You can now view and edit koutlines with blank lines between cells
      turned off.  {C-c b} now toggles between showing or hiding blank lines.

    - Minibuffer menu item Otl/Below renamed to Otl/Downto so could add
      Otl/Blanks which toggles blank lines on and off.

    - {C-c C-o} which displays one line per cell, for an overview, now also
      turns off blank lines.

    - {C-c C-i} adds an attribute to the current cell.  It changes the
      attribute's value if it already exists.  Completion on existing
      attribute names from the cell is provided.

    - {C-c h}, which displays cell attributes, when given "0" as the cell id
      now displays the zero cell's attributes in addition to any other
      attributes shown.

    - By default, the Koutliner separates labels from cell contents by
      two spaces.  If you want to change the separator for the current
      outline, use {C-c M-l}.  {C-u C-c M-l} will additionally change
      the default separator value used when new outlines are created.

    - If you invoke {M-x kotl-mode RET} on a non-read-only, non-koutline
      buffer, it converts each paragraph in the buffer into a level 1 cell,
      and thereby creates a koutline buffer.  The conversion uses the
      buffer-specific variable, `paragraph-start' to determine the paragraphs
      in the buffer.

    - If you save a koutline to a file whose name does not end in .kotl,
      e.g. with {C-x C-w} (kfile:write), it will still be treated as a valid
      koutline when you read it in again.  You can create a koutline file
      without the standard suffix via {M-x kfile:find RET} or by converting a
      buffer to a koutline via {M-x kotl-mode RET}.

    - Each koutline now maintains a current view setting that is saved with
      the outline and restored when it is first displayed.  View settings
      include:  show/hide blank lines, show a fixed number of lines per cell,
      show a fixed number of levels in the outline, show all lines and cells,
      show/hide ellipses after truncated outline entries, set cell numbering
      (label) types.

    - View settings are controlled by single character codes called view
      specs.  The current view spec setting for a koutline appears in the
      modeline following the name of the outline.  The current view spec
      setting may be changed interactively with {C-c C-v}.
      See <${hyperb:dir}/kotl/EXAMPLE.kotl, 2b16=048> for details on valid
      view specs.

    - Minibuffer menu item Otl/View changed to Otl/Vspec to set a view
      specification.  Use {C-x C-r} to view a Koutline in read-only mode.

    - Added View menu to Koutliner popup and pulldown menus.  Moved
      view-related tree operations from Tree menu to View menu.

    - Fixed importation of star outline and Augment-style files.
    
    - The elements of a another buffer or file may be inserted into a
      koutline as a set of cells by using the {C-x i} command. When prompted,
      you may use a buffer name or file name from which to insert.

      The cells will be inserted as the successors of the current cell unless
      {C-u C-x i} is used and then they are inserted as the initial children
      of the current cell.

      See the documentation for the variables, kimport:mode-alist and
      kimport:suffix-alist, for information on mode and suffix-specific
      conversions performed on files before they are inserted.

      Use {M-x kimport:insert-file-contents RET} to insert the entire
      contents of a file into the current cell at the location of point.

    - {M-x kimport:file RET} will prompt for a file and a new koutline file
      to create and will insert the elements of the file in the new outline.
      (You can also use buffer or buffer names as arguments instead of file
      names.)  See the documentation for the variables, kimport:mode-alist
      and kimport:suffix-alist, for information on how the importation type
      is determined.

    - {C-c +} appends the contents of one cell to the end of another.  Added
      this as Append-Cell to popup and pulldown menus.
    
    - {M-w}, copy-region, now works properly in read-only outlines.

    - {e} within a rolo match buffer edits the associated entry within your
      rolo source file.  Fixed bug that caused {e} to fail when entries
      are collapsed within the match buffer.

    - {C-h h r e}, rolo-edit, just displays your personal rolo file if you
      hit {RET} without specifying an entry name to edit.

    - {m} within a rolo match buffer composes mail to the the e-mail
      address at point or the first address following point.  Also added as
      Rolo/Mail minibuffer menu item and Rolo/Mail-to-Address for window
      system menus.

    - New variable, wrolo-yank-reformat-function, permits reformatting of an
      entry yanked into the current buffer with {C-h h r y}, rolo-yank.

  WINDOW CONFIGURATIONS 

    - The minibuffer menu items, Win/PopRing and Win/YankRing now redisplay
      the Win menu after performing their actions.  This allows you to yank
      or pop window configurations repeatedly until you get to the one you
      want.

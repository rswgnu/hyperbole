* Why the Name, Hyperbole

  - Pronounciation: hī-pûr′b-lē

  - Definition:     An extravagant statement or assertion not intended
                    to be understood literally.

  - About:          Hyperbole combines the world's simplest hyperbutton
                    markup with powerful automation capabilities across
                    all of Emacs, including Org mode.

                    For a full description of Hyperbole, see:

                      https://gnu.org/s/hyperbole


   "We have too much information in our lives, and it's coming in
    faster than we can organize it.  Rather than manually specifying
    relationships between bits of information, we need a system that
    can see these connections simply by taking context and content
    into account." -- John Wiegley, former Emacs Maintainer


* Hyperbole, the Package

** Setting Up Hyperbole

  - It works in Emacs 27, 28 and 29, with the latest Org releases, on
    any Emacs display device.

  - Installation is Simple (GNU Elpa Stable Package):

      (package-install 'hyperbole)

    or for the latest in-development release (GNU Elpa-Devel Package):

      (add-to-list 'package-archives '("elpa-devel" . "https://elpa.gnu.org/devel/"))
      (package-install 'hyperbole)

  - Then activate it as a global minor mode:

      (hyperbole-mode 1)

  - You can also disable it quickly:

      (hyperbole-mode 0)

  - Or remove its package quickly:

      {M-x package-delete RET hyperbole RET}

  - Complete Details in:

    https://gnu.org/s/hyperbole/man/hyperbole.html#Installation

* Context-sensitive Smart Keys

  - Hyperbole provides two context-sensitive keys, the Action Key,
    {M-RETURN}/{M-RET}, and the Assist Key, {C-u M-RET} which provides
    context-sensitive help or does the inverse of the Action Key.

  - By default within Org mode, {M-RETURN}/{M-RET} activates Hyperbole
    buttons and Org links; elsewhere in Org, it runs the standard Org
    binding.  {C-u M-RET}

  - Outside of Org, press {M-RET} anywhere on a line that looks like a
    hyperbutton/cross-reference to anything.  Hyperbole computes the
    context and applies its best guess action.  Eliminate the need to
    remember dozens of key bindings.  Just press and go, keeping you
    in the flow.

  -     {C-h A} show what the Action Key does in the current context
    {C-u C-h A} show what the Assist Key does in the current context

* Implicit Buttons

  Simple Delimiters Instantly Create Implicit Hyperbuttons with Actions Anywhere

** Path Links

Double-quoted path links can contain environment or Emacs Lisp
variables, Markdown-like #section anchor references with spaces intact
and relative line and column numbers.  Here we jump to a specific
place in a headline and display that at the top of the buffer.

    "${hyperb:dir}/HY-NEWS#Org Mode:2:6"

But the #section syntax works in many modes with sections or single
line programming comments:

    "HY-TALK.org#Action Types"

    "~/.bashrc#List all parent directories of local Git repos"

We can have buttons load Lisp libraries with a '-' prefix:

    "-org-id"

'!' prefix runs a terminal shell command:

    "!date"

    "!head ~/.emacs"

'&' prefix asynchronously runs a GUI program:

    "&open ../man/hyperbole.pdf"

** <<<Hyperbole Key Series>>>

Brace-delimited key series allow in-buffer activation of arbitrary
strings of key sequences without the need to create keyboard macros or
name them.

    {C-x 4 b *scratch* RET M-< "Insert any text.  That's cool!" RET RET M-<}

Export this Org file as HTML and display:

    {C-c C-e h o}

   --

    "It's cool to be able to turn arbitrary text into hyperlinks in
     arbitrary modes, and have one keypress that does what I want on
     all of them."

** Info Node or Index Links

Simply parenthesize the Info manual name and follow it with a node
name or index entry to jump right there:

    "(org)C-c C-l"

You can also use short names in front of implicit links:

    <[ib]>  "(hyperbole)Implicit Buttons"
    <[frm]> "(hyperbole)C-h h s f"

Then better than Org links that jump to targets, {M-RET} on a link
to a named implicit button (ilink) will activate the original button.

    <ilink:ib>

Similarly, you can add these buttons to your Hyperbole personal button file
accessed with {C-h h b p} and they become global buttons that can be referenced
from any buffer with a global link:

    <glink:frm>

** Action Buttons

Angle brackets followed by an Elisp command name and arguments, create
an Action Button that is executed with a press of the Action Key.
Variable name values can also be displayed.

    <hypb:rgrep "Action Buttons">         Recursively find Elisp or text matches

    <fill-column>                         Display variable values in the minibuffer

    <hypb:activate-interaction-log-mode>  Show key presses as in the rightmost frame

    # Hyperbole includes custom Youtube action types
    # Play just segments of Youtube videos; snippet from Hyperbole Introduction
    <yt-play "WKwZHSbHmPg" "50m34s" "50m58s">

    # Search Youtube for related videos
    <yt-search "hypertext hyperbole">

** Windows Grids

    # Use {C-h h h} to restore windows after windows grid commands
    # Display a 2x3 grid of Dired buffers
    {C-u 0 M-x hycontrol-windows-grid RET dired-mode RET 23 RET}

    # Use an Action Button for a grid of matching files
    <hycontrol-windows-grid-by-file-pattern 22
     "~/Dropbox/emacs/ramin-org-notes/*emacs*.org">


    "Because I’m trying to prevent my poor hands from turning into
     gnarled, useless claws, I extensively use speech recognition
     software. Hyperbole’s frame and window controls let me set up
     workspaces and move stuff with a few vocal commands, without
     having to type or use a mouse.  It’s just great.  I can’t say
     enough nice things about it. I always know I’ve found a killer
     piece of functionality when I find myself desperately wishing I
     had it everywhere."


* Action Key on Org Constructs

** <hsys-org-enable-smart-keys> shares M-RET between Hyperbole and Org

This <<variable>> sets the Org mode contexts where Hyperbole's
Action/Assist keys are active.  By default, these 'Smart Keys'
work only on hyperbuttons (Hyperbole's and Org's) when the variable
is set to :buttons.

   <hsys-org-enable-smart-keys>

   <setq hsys-org-enable-smart-keys :buttons>

Set this to 't to enable the Smart Keys in all Org contexts
(nil to disable):

   <setq hsys-org-enable-smart-keys t>

See {C-h f smart-org RET} for details on all the Org contexts
that Hyperbole supports, many of which we are demonstrating here.

** Action Key Supports Org Links and Targets

* Search Org Notes with HyRolo

HyRolo is like grep (full-text search) but for hierarchical,
multi-line records stored in files.  It' interactive interface is for
contacts but it has functions to search any record-based text files,
like Org files, across any number of directories, recursively if
needed.

Let's see how easy it is to create an Action Button to search a subset
of Org files for the term 'programming':

   <hyrolo-fgrep-directories "*lessons*.org"
    "~/Dropbox/emacs/ramin-org-notes/">


* Embed Org Tables in Hyperbole Koutlines

The Koutliner is Hyperbole's autonumbered outliner mode with an
automatic, unique hyperlink anchor per cell/heading.  It uses a
compact numbering scheme that alternates letters and numbers per
level, like '1a2b' but also support legal, 1.1.2.2 numbering.

It has its own link format called 'klinks' that look like Action
Buttons but start with a pathname rather than an Elisp symbol.
These can link to a specific cell and set overall views of the
outline:

Here's a link to an Org Table:

  <~/EXAMPLE.kotl, 3d2>


* Interactive Demonstrations with Action Buttons and Key Series

Let's show a Koutline with blank lines removed, switched to legal
numbering and clipped to 3 lines per cell:

  <~/EXAMPLE.kotl, |en.c3>

Let's see this Org file in overview mode in another window:

  {C-xnw C-x4c M-x org-overview RET M-<}

Let's mark all the backup files in a directory for future deletion:

  {C-x 4 d RET ~}

** A Final Perspective on Hyperbole

*** Reduce Cognitive Burden

  From John Wiegley:

    "Hyperbole lifts some of the cognitive burden from Emacs users by
     defining an extensible, large set of "recognizers" for various
     types of informational references, and "actions" for doing things
     with that information, such as visiting referenced documents, or
     web pages, or dictionary definitions. It's quite easy to add new,
     contextually-sensitive recognizers, and actions, so that you can
     teach Emacs to become more aware of how you use it to manage
     information.    -- John Wiegley


*** Network Effects

    "But what's more, with every new recognizer and action you add,
     the more interactive all your information becomes. It's a
     multiplying effect, turning inert, standalone documents into more
     interactive, virtual semi-networks. And very few of these links
     do you need to update and maintain, because most of the
     information is inferred based on where you are when you hit the
     'action key'."    -- John Wiegley


*** Globally Accessible

    "Since this functionality is transparently added everywhere, not
     just special buffer types specific to Hyperbole, it's able to
     make Org-mode outlines richer, Gnus article reading more
     interactive, and source code more accessible to new readers --
     provided they're using Emacs too."  -- John Wiegley

time on Hyperbole and love to hear user stories in addition to any
problem reports.
</p>
<p>Before we delve into Hyperbole, a number of acknowledgments are in
order.  Many thanks to Mats Lidell, a long-time Hyperbole user and
developer, who maintains Hyperbole with me and with whom I enjoy
interacting.  Peter Wegner and Morris Moore encouraged the growth of
this work.  Douglas Engelbart showed us the bigger picture and will
forever be an inspiration.  His life-long quest at augmenting
individual and team capabilities represents a model from which we
continue to draw.  Chris Nuzum has used Hyperbole since its inception,

<p>This edition of the GNU Hyperbole Manual is for use with any version
8.0.1pre or greater of GNU Hyperbole.  Hyperbole runs atop GNU Emacs 27.1
or higher.  It will trigger an error if your Emacs is older.
</p>
<p>This chapter summarizes the structure of the rest of the manual,
describes Hyperbole, lists some of its potential applications, and
explains how to subscribe to its mail lists.
</p>
<p>Throughout this manual, sequences of keystrokes are delimited by curly
braces <kbd class="kbd">{ }</kbd>, function and variable names use this <code class="code">typeface</code>.
</p>
<p>In brief, Hyperbole lets you:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Quickly create hyperlink buttons either from the keyboard or by dragging
between a source and destination window with a mouse button depressed.
Later, activate buttons by pressing/clicking on them or by giving the name
of the button.

</li><li>Activate many kinds of <em class="emph">implicit buttons</em> recognized by context within
text buffers, e.g. URLs, grep output lines, and git commits.  A single key
or mouse button automatically does the right thing in dozens of contexts;
just press and go.

</li><li>Build outlines with multi-level numbered outline nodes, e.g. 1.4.8.6, that
all renumber automatically as any node or tree is moved in the outline.
Each node also has a permanent hyperlink anchor that you can reference
from any other node;

</li><li>Manage all your contacts or record-based, unstructured nodes quickly with
hierarchical categories; each entry can have embedded hyperbuttons of any
type.  Or create an archive of documents with hierarchical entries and use
the same search mechanism to quickly find any matching entry;

</li><li>Use single keys to easily manage your Emacs windows or frames and quickly
retrieve saved window and frame configurations;

</li><li>Search for things in your current buffers, in a directory tree or across
major web search engines with the touch of a few keys.

<h3 class="section" id="Manual-Overview-1">1.1 Manual Overview</h3>

<p>Hyperbole is an efficient, programmable hypertextual information
management system.  It is intended for everyday work on any GNU Emacs
platform.  Hyperbole allows hypertext buttons to be embedded within
unstructured and structured files, mail messages and news articles.
It offers intuitive mouse-based control of information display within
multiple windows.  It also provides point-and-click access to Info
manuals, ftp archives, and the World-Wide Web (WWW).

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-demo-file"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-tutorial"></a>
<p>This is a reference manual with extensive details about Hyperbole use.  If
you prefer a simpler, more interactive introduction to Hyperbole,
the <samp class="file">FAST-DEMO</samp> file included in the Hyperbole distribution demonstrates
many of Hyperbole&rsquo;s standard facilities without the need to read through
this reference manual.  The FAST-DEMO is a good way to rapidly understand some
of what Hyperbole can do for you.  Once Hyperbole is installed,
(see <a class="pxref" href="#Setup">Setup</a>), you can access the FAST-DEMO with the key sequence <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h
d d}</kbd>.
</p>
<p>See <a class="xref" href="#Glossary">Glossary</a>, for definitions of Hyperbole terms.  In some cases,
terms are not precisely defined within the body of this manual since they
are defined within the glossary.  Be sure to reference the glossary if a
term is unclear to you.  Although you need not have a keen understanding of
all of these terms, a quick scan of the glossary helps throughout Hyperbole
use.
</p>
<p>See <a class="xref" href="#Setup">Setup</a>, for explanations of how to obtain, install, configure
and load Hyperbole for use.  This appendix includes information on
user-level settings that you may want to modify after you understand
Hyperbole&rsquo;s basic operation.
</p>
<p>See <a class="xref" href="#Suggestion-or-Bug-Reporting">Suggestion or Bug Reporting</a>, for instructions on how to ask a
question, suggest a feature or report a bug in Hyperbole.  A few
commonly asked questions are answered in this manual, see <a class="pxref" href="#Questions-and-Answers">Questions and Answers</a>.  If you are interested in classic
articles on hypertext, see <a class="pxref" href="#References">References</a>.
</p>
<p>See <a class="xref" href="#Smart-Keys">Smart Keys</a>, for an explanation of the innovative, context-sensitive
mouse and keyboard Action and Assist Keys offered by Hyperbole.
See <a class="xref" href="#Smart-Key-Reference">Smart Key Reference</a>, for a complete reference on what the Action
and Assist Keys do in each particular context that they recognize.
See <a class="xref" href="#Smart-Key-Argument-Selection">Smart Key Argument Selection</a>, for how Hyperbole speeds selection of
prompted for arguments.
</p>
<p>Keep in mind as you read about using Hyperbole that in many cases, it
provides a number of overlapping interaction methods that support differing
work styles and hardware limitations.  In such instances, you need learn
only one technique that suits you.

<h3 class="section" id="Motivation-1">1.2 Motivation</h3>

<p>Database vendors apply tremendous resources to help solve corporate
information management problems.  But the information that people deal
with in their everyday worklife is seldom stored away in neatly defined
database schemas.  Instead it is scattered among local and remote files,
e-mail messages, faxes, voice mail and web pages.
</p>
<p>The rise of the web has demonstrated how hypertext technologies can be used
to build massive organized repositories of scattered information.  But
assembling information for the web still remains a great challenge and the
data formats of the web are too structured to deal with the great variety
of information that people process.  Modern web development requires the
use of many languages: HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.  This in itself prevents
its use as the prime means of organizing and interlinking the constant
flows of daily information.
</p>
<p>GNU Hyperbole takes a distinctly different approach.  It has its own
hypertext technology that can interface perfectly with web links but which
are much easier to create (simply drag from the source to the destination
of a link to create a new hyperlink).  Hyperbole hyperbuttons can link not
only to static information but can perform arbitrary actions (through the
use of button types written in a single, highly interactive language, Emacs
Lisp).  Hyperbole adds all of this power to your written documents, e-mail,
news articles, contact management, outlines, directory listings, and much
more.  Hyperbole works well with the very latest versions of GNU Emacs
across every editing and viewing mode in Emacs.
</p>
<p>Unlock the power of GNU Hyperbole to make your information work for you.
One system. One language.  One manual.  One solution.  Learn Hyperbole and
start moving further, faster.

<p>GNU Hyperbole (pronounced Ga-new Hi-per-bo-lee), or just Hyperbole, is
like Markdown for hypertext.  Hyperbole automatically recognizes dozens of
common, pre-existing patterns in any buffer regardless of mode and can
instantly activate them as hyperbuttons with a single key: email addresses,
URLs, grep -n outputs, programming backtraces, sequences of Emacs keys,
programming identifiers, Texinfo and Info cross-references, Org links,
Markdown links and on and on.  All you do is load Hyperbole and then your
text comes to life with no extra effort or complex formatting.
</p>
<p>Hyperbole includes easy-to-use, powerful hypertextual button types without
the need to learn a markup language.  Hyperbole&rsquo;s button types are written
in Lisp and can be wholly independent of the web, i.e. web links are one
type of Hyperbole link, not fundamental to its link architecture.
However, Hyperbole is a great assistant when editing HTML or Javascript or
when browsing web pages and links.
</p>
<p>Hyperbole comes pre-built with most of the implicit button types you will
need but with a little extra effort and a few lines of code (or even just
a few words), you can define your own implicit button types to recognize
your specific buttons and then activate them anywhere in Emacs.  You press
a single key, <kbd class="kbd">{M-<kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd> by default, on any kind of Hyperbole
button to activate it, so you can rely on your muscle memory and let the
computer do the hard work of figuring out what to do.  <kbd class="kbd">{C-u
M-<kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd> shows you what any button will do in any context before you
activate it, so you can always be sure of what you are doing when needed
or if some emails you a button (you can do that too).
</p>
<p>Hyperbole is something to be experienced and interacted with, not understood
from reading alone.  It installs normally as a single Emacs package with no
dependencies outside of standard Emacs libraries, see <a class="pxref" href="#Installation">Installation</a>.  Most
of Hyperbole is a single global minor mode that you can activate and
deactivate at will.  And it can be uninstalled quickly as well if need be, so
there is no risk to giving it a spin.
</p>
<p>Once you have it installed, try the interactive demo with <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h d d}</kbd>.
In fact, if you have Hyperbole loaded, you can press <kbd class="kbd">{M-<kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd>
inside any of the brace delimited series of keys you see in this document
and Hyperbole will execute them on-the-fly (easy keyboard-macro style
buttons in any text).
</p>
<p>Hyperbole can dramatically increase your productivity and greatly reduce
the number of keyboard/mouse keys you&rsquo;ll need to work efficiently.
</p>
<p>Hyperbole consists of five parts:
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><em class="emph">Buttons and Smart Keys</em></dt>
<dd><p>Hyperbole hyperlink and other kinds of buttons <em class="dfn">explicit buttons</em> may
be added to documents with a simple drag between windows, no markup
language needed.  <em class="dfn">Implicit buttons</em> are patterns automatically
recognized within existing text that perform actions, e.g. bug#24568
displays the bug status information for that Emacs bug number, without the
need for any additional markup.  <em class="dfn">Global buttons</em> are buttons that are
activated by name from anywhere within Emacs.  See <a class="xref" href="#Buttons">Buttons</a>.
</p>
<p>Buttons are accessed by clicking on them or referenced by name (global
buttons), so they can be activated regardless of what is on screen.
Users create and activate Hyperbole buttons; Emacs Lisp programmers
easily can develop new button types and actions.
</p>
<p>Hyperbole includes two special <em class="dfn">Smart Keys</em>, the Action Key and
the Assist Key, that perform an extensive array of context-sensitive
operations across emacs usage, including activating and showing help
for Hyperbole buttons.  In many popular Emacs modes, they allow you to
perform common, sometimes complex operations without having to use a
different key for each operation.  Just press a Smart Key and the
right thing happens.  See <a class="xref" href="#Smart-Keys">Smart Keys</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph">Contact and Text Finder</em></dt>
<dd><p>an interactive, textual information management interface, including
fast, flexible file and text finding commands.  A powerful, hierarchical
contact manager, see <a class="pxref" href="#HyRolo">HyRolo</a>, which anyone can use, is also included.
It is easy to learn since it introduces only a few new mechanisms
and has a menu interface, which may be operated from the keyboard or the
mouse; it may also be used to look up any record-based information and
Hyperbole buttons may be embedded in any records;
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph">Screen Control</em></dt>
<dd><p>the fastest, easiest-to-use window and frame control available for GNU
Emacs, see <a class="pxref" href="#HyControl">HyControl</a>.  With just a few keystrokes, you can shift from
increasing a window&rsquo;s height by 5 lines to moving a frame by 220 pixels
or immediately moving it to a screen corner.  Text in each window or
frame may be enlarged or shrunk (zoomed) for easy viewing, plus many
other features; this allows Hyperbole to quickly control the way
information is presented on-screen;
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph">Hypertextual Outliner</em></dt>
<dd><p>an advanced outliner, see <a class="pxref" href="#Koutliner">Koutliner</a>, with multi-level
autonumbering and permanent identifiers attached to each outline node
for use as hypertext link anchors, per node properties and flexible
view specifications that can be included in links or used
interactively;
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph">Programming Library</em></dt>
<dd><p>a set of programming libraries, see <a class="pxref" href="#Developing-with-Hyperbole">Developing with Hyperbole</a>, for
system developers who want to integrate Hyperbole with another user
interface or as a back-end to a distinct system.  (All of Hyperbole is
written in Emacs Lisp for ease of modification.  It has been engineered
for real-world usage and is well structured).

<p>Hyperbole may be used simply for browsing through documents
pre-configured with Hyperbole buttons, in which case, you can safely
ignore most of the information in this manual.  Jump right into the
Hyperbole fast demonstration by typing <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h d d}</kbd>, assuming Hyperbole
has been installed at your site.  If you need to install
Hyperbole, see <a class="pxref" href="#Setup">Setup</a>, for Hyperbole installation and configuration
information.  The demo offers a much less technical introduction to
Hyperbole by supplying good examples of use.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-C_002dh-t"></a>
<p>You likely will want to do more than browse with Hyperbole,
e.g. create your own buttons.  The standard Hyperbole button editing
user interface is Emacs-based, so a basic familiarity with the Emacs
editing model is useful.  The material covered in the Emacs
tutorial, normally bound to <kbd class="kbd">{C-h t}</kbd>, is more than
sufficient as background.  See <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Glossary">Glossary</a> in <cite class="cite">the GNU Emacs Manual</cite>,
if some emacs-related terms are unfamiliar to you.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Hyperbole-features"></a>
<p>A Hyperbole user works with chunks of information that need to be
organized, interlinked, and processed.  Such chunks can be hyperbuttons,
address book contacts, items in an outline, or even database query
results.  Hyperbole does not enforce any particular hypertext or
information management model, but instead allows you to organize your
information in large or small chunks as you see fit.  The Hyperbole
outliner organizes information into hierarchies which may also contain
links to external information sources.  See <a class="xref" href="#Koutliner">Koutliner</a>.
</p>
<p>Some of Hyperbole&rsquo;s most significant features are:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Buttons may link to information or may execute functions, such as
starting or communicating with external programs;

</li><li>A simple mouse drag from a button source location to its link
destination is often all that is needed to create a new link.
The keyboard can also be used to emulate such drags;

</li><li>Buttons may be embedded within electronic mail messages;

</li><li>Outlines allow rapid browsing, editing and movement of chunks of
information organized into trees (hierarchies);

</li><li>Other hypertext and information retrieval systems may be encapsulated
under a Hyperbole user interface (a number of samples are provided).
</li></ul>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Hyperbole-applications"></a>
<p>Typical Hyperbole applications include:
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><em class="emph">personal information management</em></dt>
<dd><p>Hyperlinks provide a variety of views into an information space.  A
search facility locates hyperbuttons in context and permits quick
selection.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph">documentation and code browsing</em></dt>
<dd><p>Cross-references may be embedded within documentation and code.  Existing
documentation may be augmented with point-and-click interfaces to link
code with associated design documents, or to permit direct access to the
definition of identifiers by selecting their names within code or
other documents.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph">brainstorming</em></dt>
<dd><p>The Hyperbole outliner (see <a class="pxref" href="#Koutliner">Koutliner</a>) is an effective tool for
capturing ideas and then quickly reorganizing them in a meaningful way.
Links to related ideas are easy to create so the need to copy and
paste information is greatly reduced.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph">help/training systems</em></dt>
<dd><p>Tutorials with buttons can show students how things work while
explaining the concepts, e.g. an introduction to the commands available
on a computer system.  This technique can be much more effective than
written documentation alone.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph">archive managers</em></dt>

<p>Once Hyperbole has been installed for use at your site, loaded into your
Emacs session and activated with <code class="code">(hyperbole-mode 1)</code>, it is ready
for use.  You will see a Hyperbole menu on your menubar and <code class="code">Hypb</code> in
your modeline.

</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>use the Hyperbole entry on your menubar;

</li><li><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hyperbole"></a>
type <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h}</kbd> or <kbd class="kbd">{M-x hyperbole <kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd> to display the Hyperbole minibuffer menu;

</li><li>use a specific Hyperbole command, for example, a press of <kbd class="kbd">{M-<kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd>
on a pathname to display the associated file or directory.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-C_002dh-h-q"></a>
<p><kbd class="kbd">{C-h h}</kbd> enables Hyperbole if it has been disabled and displays a
Hyperbole menu in the minibuffer for quick keyboard or mouse-based selection.
Select an item from this menu by typing the item&rsquo;s first capital letter.
Use <kbd class="kbd">{q}</kbd> to quit from the minibuffer menu while leaving Hyperbole enabled.
Use<kbd class="kbd">{X}</kbd> (note this is capitalized) to quit from the minibuffer menu
and disable Hyperbole minor mode.
</p>
<p>Use <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h d d}</kbd> for an interactive demonstration of standard Hyperbole
button capabilities.
</p>
<p>Type <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h k e}</kbd> for an interactive demonstration of the Koutliner,
Hyperbole&rsquo;s multi-level autonumbered hypertextual outliner.
</p>
<p>To try out HyControl, Hyperbole&rsquo;s interactive frame and window control
system, use <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h s w}</kbd> for window control or <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h s f}</kbd> for
frame control.  Pressing <kbd class="kbd">{t}</kbd> switches between window and frame
control once in HyControl.  Hyperbole also binds <kbd class="kbd">{C-c \}</kbd> for quick
access to HyControl&rsquo;s window control menu if it was not already bound
prior to Hyperbole&rsquo;s initialization.
</p>
<p>A long video demonstrating most of HyControl&rsquo;s features is available at
<a class="url" href="https://youtu.be/M3-aMh1ccJk">https://youtu.be/M3-aMh1ccJk</a>.
</p>
<p>The above are the best interactive ways to learn about Hyperbole.

<p>When active, Hyperbole offers two special <em class="dfn">Smart Keys</em>, the Action Key
and the Assist Key, that perform an extensive array of context-sensitive
operations across emacs usage.  In many Emacs modes, they allow you to
perform common, sometimes complex operations without having to use a
different key for each operation.  Just press a Smart Key and the right thing
happens.  This chapter explains typical uses of the Smart Keys.  See <a class="xref" href="#Smart-Key-Reference">Smart Key Reference</a>, for complete descriptions of their behavior in all contexts.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-M_002dRET"></a>
<p>With <code class="code">hyperbole-mode</code> enabled, <kbd class="kbd">{M-<kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd> is the Action Key
and <kbd class="kbd">{C-u M-<kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd> is the Assist Key.  These keys allow
context-sensitive operation from any keyboard.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-shift_002dmiddle-mouse-key"></a>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hmouse_002dmiddle_002dflag-1"></a>
<p>Mouse configuration of the Smart Keys is automatic for GNU Emacs under
Mac OS X, the X Window System and MS Windows, assuming your emacs program
has been built with support for any of these window systems.
</p>
<p>The <em class="dfn">Action Mouse Key</em> is bound to your shift-middle mouse key (or
shift-left on a 2-button mouse).  The <em class="dfn">Assist Mouse Key</em> is bound to your
shift-right mouse key, assuming Hyperbole is run under an external window
system.  These keys support <em class="dfn">Drag Actions</em>, see <a class="pxref" href="#Smart-Mouse-Keys">Smart Mouse Keys</a>, as
well as the standard Smart Key presses.

<p>If you set the variable, <code class="code">hmouse-middle-flag</code>, to &lsquo;<samp class="samp">t</samp>&rsquo; before
loading Hyperbole, then you may also use the middle mouse key as the Action
Key.  If you want both the middle mouse key as the Action Key and the
right mouse key as the Assist Key for ease of use, then within your
personal <samp class="file">~/.emacs</samp> file, add: <code class="code">(add-hook 'hyperbole-init-hook
'hmouse-add-unshifted-smart-keys)</code> and then restart Emacs.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hkey_002deither"></a>
<p>If you prefer other Smart Key bindings, simply bind the commands
<code class="code">action-key</code> and <code class="code">assist-key</code> to keyboard keys.
Hyperbole binds <kbd class="kbd">{M-<kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd> to the command <code class="code">hkey-either</code>;
this provides a single key binding for both Smart Key commands; a prefix
argument, such as <kbd class="kbd">{C-u}</kbd>, then invokes <code class="code">assist-key</code> actions.
</p>
<p>You may also bind <code class="code">action-mouse-key</code> and <code class="code">assist-mouse-key</code> to
other mouse keys, though you won&rsquo;t be able to execute mouse drag actions with
such key bindings.  See <a class="xref" href="#Smart-Mouse-Key-Drags">Smart Mouse Key Drags</a>, and see <a class="pxref" href="#Keyboard-Drags">Keyboard Drags</a>.
</p>
<p>To permanently change any of these key bindings, use:
<code class="code">(add-hook 'hyperbole-init-hook (lambda () (hkey-set-key &lt;KEY&gt; '&lt;CMD&gt;)</code>,
for example, <code class="code">(hkey-set-key &quot;\M-'&quot; 'hkey-either)</code>.

<p>The Hyperbole Doc/SmartKeys menu entry, <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h d s}</kbd>, displays a
summary of what the Smart Keys do in all of their different contexts.
Alternatively, a click of the Assist Mouse Key in the right corner of a
window modeline (within the rightmost 3 characters) toggles between
displaying this summary and hiding it.  Reference this summary whenever you
need it.
</p>
<p>The following table is the same summary.  Much of the browsing power
of Hyperbole comes from the use of the Smart Keys, so spend some time
practicing how to use them.  Study what modeline clicks and window
drag actions do as these will give you a lot of power without much
effort.  This table may appear daunting at first, but as you practice
and notice that the Smart Keys do just a few context-sensitive things
per editor mode, you will find it easy to just press or point and
click and let Hyperbole do the right thing in each context.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Hyperbole-help"></a>
<p>A prime design criterion of Hyperbole&rsquo;s user interface is that you
should be able to see what an operation will do before using it.  The
Assist Key typically shows you what a button or minibuffer menu item
will do before you activate it.  Hyperbole also displays the result of
directly selecting an argument value with the Action Key, to provide
feedback as to whether the correct item has been selected.  A second
press/click is necessary before an argument is accepted and processed.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-argument-entry"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-direct-selection"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-double-click"></a>
<p>Many Hyperbole commands prompt you for arguments.  The standard
Hyperbole user interface has an extensive core of argument types that
it recognizes.  Whenever Hyperbole is prompting you for an argument,
it knows the type that it needs and provides some error checking to
help you get it right.  More importantly, it allows you to press the
Action Key within an entity that you want to use as an argument and it
will grab the appropriate thing and show it to you at the input prompt
within the minibuffer.  If you press (click with a mouse) the Action
Key on the same thing again, it accepts the entity as the argument
and moves on.  Thus, a double click registers a desired argument.
Double-quoted strings, pathnames, mail messages, Info nodes, dired
listings, buffers, numbers, completion items and so forth are all
recognized at appropriate times.  All of the argument types mentioned
in the documentation for the Emacs Lisp <code class="code">interactive</code> function
are recognized.  Experiment a little and you will quickly get used to
this direct selection technique.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-completion"></a>
<p>Wherever possible, standard Emacs completion is offered, as described in
<a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Completion">Completion</a> in <cite class="cite">the GNU Emacs Manual</cite>.  Remember to use <kbd class="kbd">{?}</kbd>
to see what your possibilities for an argument are.  Once you have a
list of possible completions on screen, press the Action Key twice on
any item to enter it as the argument.

<p>Typically, <kbd class="kbd">{C-h A}</kbd> and <kbd class="kbd">{C-u C-h A}</kbd> which show Action and
Assist Key help for the current context, are sufficient for seeing how
the Smart Keys behave no matter where they are used.

<p>However, if a Smart Key ever behaves differently than you think it
should or if you want to test how the Smart Keys respond in a new
context, then the Smart Key debugging flag may be of use.  You toggle
it on and off with <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h c d}</kbd> (minibuffer menu
Cust/Debug-Toggle).  Once enabled, this displays a message in the
minibuffer each time the Action or Assist Key is released, showing
the context of the press and its associated action, so you can see
exactly what is happening whenever you use a Smart Key.  These
messages are all prefaced with &ldquo;(HyDebug)&rdquo; and logged to the
&ldquo;*Messages*&rdquo; buffer for later viewing.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-C_002dh-h-m-r"></a>
<p>If you do find a problem with the Smart Keys and want to report a bug,
use <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h m r}</kbd> to compose an email message to the bug-hyperbole
list.  Hyperbole will automatically include all of the &ldquo;(HyDebug)&rdquo;
messages from your current emacs session into your email.  Similarly,
when you compose an email to the hyperbole-users mailing list
with <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h m c}</kbd>, these messages are also included.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-delimited-things"></a>
<p>Hyperbole has some radically cool ways to select regions of structured text
or source code and to copy or move them between buffers with a single mouse
drag or two key presses.  A great deal of smarts are built-in so that it
does the right thing most of the time; many other attempts at similar
behavior such as <samp class="file">thing.el</samp> fail to deal with many file format
complexities.
</p>
<p>We use the term <em class="dfn">things</em> to refer to structured entities that
Hyperbole can select.  These include: delimited pairs of (), {}, &lt;&gt;,
[] and quote marks, source code functions, source code comments and
matching tag pairs in HTML and SGML modes.  <em class="dfn">Delimited things</em> are
those things that contain a selectable delimiter such as an opening
parenthesis.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-HTML-tag-pair"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-SGML-tag-pair"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-XML-tag-pair"></a>
<p>The best way to mark a delimited thing is to move your cursor to the
starting delimiter of the thing and then press the Action Key.
Typically, you will see the thing highlight.  You can then operate
upon it as you would any Emacs region.  In many cases, you can do the
same thing upon the closing delimiter, but this is not as reliable.
An Action Key press on the start of an HTML, XML, or SGML tag pair
marks the entire region span of the pair.  If you use the Assist Key
instead, it will mark and kill (delete) the thing.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-drag_002c-with-region"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-kill-region"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-yank-region"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-cut-region"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-copy-region"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-paste-region"></a>
<p>Even better are Smart Mouse Key thing drags which let you copy or move
delimited things in one operation without having to select a region.  To
copy, simply drag with the Action Key from a thing&rsquo;s opening delimiter
and release somewhere outside of the thing, either within the same
window or within another window.  The thing will be copied to the
point of release.  If you want to move a thing, simply perform the
same drag but with the Assist Mouse Key.  Ensure that you do not move
any explicit buttons from one buffer to another as that does not
work.
</p>
<p>Hyperbole also binds two convenience keys for working with things.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-C_002dc-RET"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hui_002dselect_002dthing"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hui_002dselect_002dthing_002dwith_002dmouse"></a>
<p>The first such key is <kbd class="kbd">{C-c <kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd> <code class="code">hui-select-thing</code> which
selects bigger and bigger syntactic regions with each successive use.
Double or triple clicks of the Selection Key (left mouse key) do the same
thing.  The first press selects a region based upon the character at point.
For example, with point over an opening or closing grouping character, such
as { or }, the whole grouping is selected, e.g. a C function.  When on an
_ or - within a programming language identifier name, the whole name is
selected.  The type of selection is displayed in the minibuffer as
feedback.  When using a language in which indentation determines nesting
level like Python, a double click on the first alpha character of a line,
such as an if statement, selects the current clause (until the next line at
the same or lesser indentation).  Use <kbd class="kbd">{C-g}</kbd> to unmark the region when
done.  Use, <code class="code">hui-select-thing-with-mouse</code> if you want to bind this to
a different mouse key to use single clicks instead of double clicks.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-C_002dc-_002e"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hui_002dselect_002dgoto_002dmatching_002dtag"></a>
<p>The second convenience key is bound in HTML/XML/SGML/web
modes.  <kbd class="kbd">{C-c .}</kbd> <code class="code">hui-select-goto-matching-tag</code> jumps between
the opening and closing tag of a pair.  It moves point to the start of
the tag paired with the closest tag that point is within or which it
precedes.  A second press moves point to the matching tag of the pair,
allowing you to quickly jump back and forth between opening and
closing tags.

<h3 class="section" id="Smart-Mouse-Key-Modeline-Clicks-1">3.6 Smart Mouse Key Modeline Clicks</h3>

<p>Smart Mouse Key clicks on a window&rsquo;s modeline offer many powerful browsing
features, including directory editing (dired), user manual browsing, and
window, buffer and frame selection.  Generally, only Hyperbole-specific
modeline actions are discussed herein.
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Leftmost Character

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-bury-buffer"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-unbury-buffer"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-modeline_002c-bury-buffer"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-modeline_002c-unbury-buffer"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-modeline_002c-leftmost-character"></a>
<p>Action Key clicks on the first (usually blank) character of the
modeline bury the current buffer in the buffer list and display the
next buffer in the list.  Assist Key clicks do the reverse and unbury
the bottom buffer.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-modeline_002c-next-buffer"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-modeline_002c-prev-buffer"></a>
<p>A similar effect can be achieved with the standard Emacs mouse 1 (left) and
3 (right) buttons on the Buffer ID element of modeline to cycle through
previous and next buffers, respectively.  This may be easier to use since
you can click anywhere on the buffer identifier.
</p>
</li><li>Buffer ID Element

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-dired"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-directory-editor"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-dired_002djump"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-modeline_002c-dired"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-buffer-id"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-modeline_002c-buffer-id"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-dragging-items_002c-dired"></a>
<p>On the left part of the modeline is the buffer identification,
generally the name of the buffer in use.  An Action Key click on that
switches the window to edit the buffer&rsquo;s directory using dired.
Then Action Key clicks on directory items in the dired buffer display the
items selected in other windows.  An Action Key drag from an item to
another window displays the item in that window.
</p>
<p>An Action Key click on the first line in a dired buffer which contains
the current directory path, specifically on any ancestor part of the
path (the part to the left of the click point), starts another dired
session on the ancestor directory.  Click at the end of this line or
on the last line to end the dired session (bury its buffer).
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Treemacs"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-file-viewer_002c-Treemacs"></a>
<p>If you use the Treemacs file viewer Emacs package, you can configure Hyperbole
to use this instead of Dired when you click on a modeline buffer id.
</p>
<p>Since this is a customization option, it may be changed permanently like so.
Use <kbd class="kbd">{M-x customize-set-variable <kbd class="key">RET</kbd> action-key-modeline-buffer-id-function <kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd>.
Change the value to <code class="code">smart-treemacs-modeline</code>.  Then press <kbd class="key">RET</kbd>.  To change it back
to Hyperbole&rsquo;s default, use the value, <code class="code">dired-jump</code>.
</p>
</li><li>Large Blank Area

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-buffer-menu"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-modeline_002c-buffer-menu"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-jump-menu"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-modeline_002c-jump-menu"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-dragging-items_002c-buffer-menu"></a>
<p>An Action Mouse Key click in a blank area of a window modeline (away
from left and right edges) toggles between displaying and hiding a
list of all buffers.  Once displayed, an Action Key click on a buffer
item will display it in another window.  You can drag items to specific
windows for display as well.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may (1) display the buffer menu, (2) use its <kbd class="kbd">{m}</kbd>
command to mark buffers, and (3) use the Hyperbole <kbd class="kbd">{@}</kbd> command to
display the marked buffers in a grid of popup windows whose number of
rows and columns you specify at the prompt or via a prefix argument.
This also works in <code class="code">ibuffer-menu</code> and <code class="code">dired</code> modes.
See <a class="xref" href="#HyControl">HyControl</a>.
</p>
<p>An Assist Key click in the blank area of the modeline displays a quick
access menu of display-oriented commands.  You can jump to buffers
categorized by major mode, jump to windows by buffer name, or to
frames by name.  Manage your windows and frames quickly with this menu
as well.  As always with Hyperbole, just try it and you&rsquo;ll begin to
wonder how you lived without it before.
</p>
</li><li>Right Corner

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Info-browser"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-modeline-click-and-drag"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-modeline_002c-Info-Browser"></a>
<p>A click of the Action Mouse Key in the right corner of a window
modeline (within the rightmost 3 characters) displays or hides the
GNU Info Manual Browser, giving you quick point and click access to
an amazing wealth of documentation, since the Action Key also browses
through these manuals and follows their hyperlinked cross-references.
A click of the Assist Key in the same location displays or hides the
Smart Key summary, as noted earlier.
</p>
</li><li>Customizable Variables

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-action_002dkey_002dmodeline_002dfunction"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-assist_002dkey_002dmodeline_002dfunction"></a>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-ibuffer-menu"></a>
<p>Hyperbole modeline mouse click actions are controlled by the two functions,
<code class="code">action-key-modeline</code> and <code class="code">assist-key-modeline</code>.  If you know
a little Emacs Lisp you can change these to do whatever you like.  When a
Smart Key press is on a blank part of a modeline but not at the left or
right, the function given by one of these two variables is
executed: <code class="code">action-key-modeline-function</code> or
<code class="code">assist-key-modeline-function</code>.  By default, the Action Key toggles
between displaying and hiding the buffer menu.  If you like the more
advanced features of <code class="code">Ibuffer Mode</code>, you can change the buffer menu to
use that with the following in your Emacs initialization file:
<code class="code">(setq action-key-modeline-function #'hmouse-context-ibuffer-menu)</code>.
To set it back to the default use:
<code class="code">(setq action-key-modeline-function #'hmouse-context-menu)</code>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hui_002dmenu_002dscreen_002dcommands"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-modeline_002c-screen-command-menu"></a>
<p>The default <code class="code">assist-key-modeline-function</code> is to pop up a menu of
convenient screen commands that lets you select buffers grouped by
major mode, use HyControl, or jump to specific windows, window
configurations or frames.

<p>Horizontal and vertical drags of the Smart Mouse Keys are used to split and
delete Emacs windows.
</p>
<p>An Action Mouse Key horizontal drag of five or more characters in either
direction within a single window creates a new window by splitting the
current window into two windows, one atop the other.  An Action Mouse Key
vertical drag in either direction splits the current window into two
side-by-side windows.  A horizontal or vertical drag of the Assist Mouse
Key within a single window, deletes that window.

<p>If you split windows many times and then delete a number of the windows,
you&rsquo;ll be left with windows of differing heights.  Use <kbd class="kbd">{C-x +}</kbd> to

<p>A window configuration consists of the set of windows within a single Emacs
frame.  This includes their locations, buffers, and the scrolled positions of
their buffers.
</p>
<p>Hyperbole allows you to save and restore window configurations with simple
diagonal mouse drags within a single window.  A diagonal drag in any
direction of the Action Key saves the current window configuration to a
ring of window configurations, just like the Emacs text kill ring.
See <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Kill-Ring">Kill Ring</a> in <cite class="cite">the Emacs Manual</cite>.  Each diagonal drag in any
direction of the Assist Key restores a prior saved window configuration
from the ring.  Window configurations are restored in reverse order of the
way they were saved.  Since a ring is circular, after the oldest element is
restored, the newest element will again be restored and so on.

<p>Emacs windows may be resized by dragging their window separators
(modelines or vertical side lines) within a frame.  Simply depress either
Smart Mouse Key on a non-bottommost modeline or near a window side, hold
it down while you drag to a new location and then release.  The window
separator will move to the location of release.  Basically, just drag the
window separator to where you want it.  Drags from a blank area of a
modeline show visible feedback as the window is resized.

<p>Swapping buffer locations is quick and easy with Hyperbole.  Simply drag
from one window to another with the Assist Key (not the Action Key).  This
works across frames as well.
</p>
<p>If you have just two windows in an Emacs frame, you can swap their
buffers from the keyboard.  Use this Hyperbole minibuffer menu key
sequence involving the tilde key to swap the buffers and quit from the
Hyperbole minibuffer menu: <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h s w ~ Q}</kbd>.  Similarly, if you
have two single window frames, you can swap buffers between them with
<kbd class="kbd">{C-h h s f ~ Q}</kbd>.

<p>What if you want to display the same buffer in another window and not swap
buffers?  Depress the Action Mouse Key in the open area of the modeline of
the source window and drag to the text area of the destination window.
Voila, the buffer appears in the new location as well as the old one.
</p>
<p>If you want a new window where you release (so the original destination
window&rsquo;s buffer stays onscreen), just drag to a window&rsquo;s modeline; that

Key from the window to outside of Emacs and release the key.  A new frame will

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-drag_002c-Treemacs-item"></a>
<p>You can also drag items to other windows with the Action Key in Dired,
Buffer Menu, Ibuffer and Treemacs listing buffers, rather than the
buffers themselves.  Drag with the Action Mouse Key and the selected
item will be displayed in any Emacs window in which you release.  Drag
outside Emacs and it will be displayed in a new frame.  To display the
last item you want within the listing window itself, press and release
the Action Key on that item after dragging your other items to their
respective windows.  Remember that you can emulate these drags from
the keyboard when needed, see <a class="pxref" href="#Keyboard-Drags">Keyboard Drags</a>.
</p>
<p>So now you can put a bunch of buffers and files on your screen wherever
you like.  Typically, a brief visual pulse is shown first at the source item and
then in the destination window, to help you see that the transfer has been
made.  An Assist Key Drag will move the the item list buffer to the
destination (swapping buffers), just as it does with other buffers.

<p>If you run Emacs under a window system and there is no prior key binding
on <kbd class="kbd">{M-o}</kbd> when you load Hyperbole, then many Action Key drags can be
emulated from the keyboard.  To do so, press <kbd class="kbd">{M-o}</kbd>, the
<code class="code">hkey-operate</code> command, at the button source location, move
to the link destination, e.g. with <kbd class="kbd">{C-x o}</kbd>, and then press
<kbd class="kbd">{M-o}</kbd> again.  This simulates a depress and release of the
Action Key.  <kbd class="kbd">{C-u M-o}</kbd> emulates drags of the Assist Key.
This will not work when Hyperbole is run from a dumb terminal Emacs
session since drag actions are not supported without a window system.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-ace_002dwindow-1"></a>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-jump-to-window-by-letter"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-keyboard_002c-jump-to-window"></a>
<p>For even faster keyboard-based display of items and drag emulations,
use the Emacs package <code class="code">ace-window</code>
(see <a class="url" href="https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/ace-window.html">https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/ace-window.html</a>).
</p>
<p>The ace-window package assigns short letter IDs to each Emacs window and lets
you jump to or operate upon a specific window by giving its ID.  Hyperbole can
add commands to ace-window that replace the two-step drag emulation key
described above with a single key sequence that does not require moving to
the drag target window since it is specified by ID as part of the command.
</p>
<p>To enable this feature, in your Emacs initialization file after
Hyperbole is initialized, if you do not have a key bound for
<code class="code">ace-window</code>, then call: <code class="code">(hkey-ace-window-setup \&quot;\M-o\&quot;)</code>
to bind it to <kbd class="kbd">{M-o}</kbd>, replacing Hyperbole&rsquo;s
default <code class="code">hkey-operate</code> command there (because ace-window can emulate
the drags performed by <code class="code">hkey-operate</code>).  If you already have a key bound
for <code class="code">ace-window</code>, then just ensure it is initialized by calling
<code class="code">(hkey-ace-window-setup)</code> without a key argument.

<p>After setup, the leftmost character or two of each window&rsquo;s modeline
will show the ID to type to use that window as the drag destination.
Then whenever point is on an item you want displayed in another
window, use <kbd class="kbd">{M-o i &lt;id-of-window-to-display-item-in&gt;}</kbd> and watch
the magic happen.  If you want to display multiple items in different
windows, instead use the <kbd class="kbd">{M-o t
&lt;id-of-window-to-display-item-in&gt;}</kbd> key sequence to <em class="emph">throw</em> the
item to the window.  To <em class="emph">replace</em> the selected window&rsquo;s buffer
with that of another window, use <kbd class="kbd">{M-o r
&lt;id-of-window-displaying-desired-buffer&gt;}</kbd>.  To instead <em class="emph">swap</em> the
selected window&rsquo;s buffer with that of another window, use <kbd class="kbd">{M-o m
&lt;id-of-window-to-swap-with&gt;}</kbd>.  And finally, to quickly create a link
between the selected window and another window, use <kbd class="kbd">{M-o w
&lt;id-of-referent-window&gt;}</kbd>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-throw-region"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-region-throw"></a>
<p>You can also throw the active (highlighted) region of text to another
window.  Simply activate a region and then use <kbd class="kbd">{M-o
t &lt;window-id&gt;}</kbd>.  If you don&rsquo;t use region highlighting,
i.e. <code class="code">transient-mark-mode</code>, then use <kbd class="kbd">{C-u M-o
t &lt;window-id&gt;}</kbd> for the same effect.  The buffer in the target window
must differ from the one in the source window.  With no region active,
this command throws the source buffer to the target window.
</p>
<p>In summary:
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt>M-o i &lt;window&gt;</dt>
<dd><p>insert listing item at point into &lt;window&gt;; if not on a listing item,

<p>This chapter explains use of Hyperbole <em class="emph">buttons</em>.  There are several
kinds of Hyperbole buttons: buttons that are created one at a time and
stored in files (<em class="dfn">explicit buttons</em>); buttons that can be
activated by name anytime (<em class="dfn">global buttons</em>); and buttons defined
by textual patterns where one definition can create an infinite number
of buttons (<em class="dfn">implicit buttons</em>).
</p>
<p>Hyperbole buttons are embedded within textual documents; they may be
created, modified, moved or deleted.  Each button performs a specific
action, such as linking to a file or executing a shell command.

<p>There are three categories of Hyperbole buttons:
</p><dl class="table">
<dt><em class="dfn">explicit buttons</em></dt>
<dd><p>created by Hyperbole, accessible from within a single document;
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="dfn">global buttons</em></dt>
<dd><p>created by Hyperbole, specific to each user, and accessible anywhere
within a user&rsquo;s network of documents;
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="dfn">implicit buttons</em></dt>
<dd><p>created and managed by other programs or embedded within the structure
of a document, accessible from within a single document.  Hyperbole
recognizes implicit buttons by contextual patterns given in their type
specifications (explained later).
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Explicit Hyperbole buttons may be embedded within any type of text file.
Implicit buttons may appear only within document contexts allowed by
their types, which may limit the kinds of documents or the locations
within those documents at which such buttons may be found.  All global
buttons for a user are stored in a single location and are activated by
typing their names, rather than by direct selection, the means used to
activate explicit and implicit buttons.
</p>
<p>To summarize:

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-terminal-use"></a>
<p>A click on a Hyperbole button may activate it or describe its actions,
depending on which mouse key is used.  Buttons may also be activated from a
keyboard.  (In fact, many Hyperbole operations, including menu usage, may
be performed from any standard character terminal interface, so you need
not be anchored to a desktop all day).  See <a class="xref" href="#Smart-Keys">Smart Keys</a>.  There is
also a key that shows you how a button will behave before you activate
it, see <a class="pxref" href="#Smart-Key-Operations">Smart Key Operations</a>.

<p>Hyperbole creates and manages <em class="dfn">explicit buttons</em> which perform
specific actions when activated (typically through a button press).
They look like this &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;(fake button)&gt;</samp>&rsquo;.  They are quickly
recognizable, yet relatively non-distracting as you scan the text in
which they are embedded.  The text between the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;(</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">)&gt;</samp>&rsquo;
delimiters is called the <em class="dfn">button label</em> or <em class="dfn">button name</em>.
Spacing between words within a button label is irrelevant to Hyperbole.
Button labels may wrap across several lines without causing a problem;
just be sure to select the first line of the button to activate it.
</p>
<p>Explicit buttons may be added to any editable buffer including
temporary buffers without any attached files (such buttons will
last only the length of a single Emacs session).  For source code
files, simply place Hyperbole explicit buttons within comments.
Buttons that you use for quick navigation to websites or other things
you do often should be added to your personal button file.
See <a class="xref" href="#Button-Files">Button Files</a>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-button_002c-moving"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-moving-buttons"></a>
<p>Explicit buttons may be freely moved about within the buffer in which
they are created.  (No present support exists for moving buttons between
buffers; support the Hyperbole project if you would like to help make
this happen).  A single button may also appear multiple times within the
same buffer; simply copy the button label with its delimiters
to a new location if you need another copy of it.
</p>
<p>For details on how to create, activate, delete or edit explicit
buttons, see <a class="pxref" href="#Utilizing-Explicit-Buttons">Utilizing Explicit Buttons</a>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-link-button-1"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-referent"></a>
<p>Each explicit button is assigned an action type that determines the
actions it performs.  Hyperbole includes its own set of useful action
types but any named, interactive Emacs Lisp command may be used.  For
example, <em class="dfn">Link action types</em> connect buttons to particular types
of <em class="dfn">referents</em>, the targets of their links.  Link action type
names all begin with <code class="code">link-</code>.  Link action button referents are
displayed when such buttons are activated with a press or a click.
See <a class="xref" href="#Action-Types">Action Types</a>, for a list of Hyperbole action types, including
link types.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-linking_002c-in_002dplace"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Hyperbole-data-model"></a>
<p>Hyperbole does not manage referent data; this is left to the
applications that generate the data.  This means that Hyperbole
provides in-place linking and does not require reformatting data to
integrate it with Hyperbole.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-button-data"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-button-attribute"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-file_002c-_002ehypb"></a>
<p>Hyperbole stores the <em class="dfn">button data</em> that gives an explicit button its
behavior, separately from the button label, in a file named
<samp class="file">.hypb</samp> (<samp class="file">_hypb</samp> under MS Windows) within the same directory
as the file in which the button is created.  Thus, all files in the
same directory share a common button data file.  Button data is
comprised of individual <em class="dfn">button attribute</em> values.  A user never
sees this data in its raw form but may see a formatted version by
asking for help on a button.

<p>Sometimes it is
useful to activate buttons without regard to the information with which
you are working.  In such instances, you use <em class="dfn">global buttons</em>, which
are buttons that may be activated or otherwise operated upon by typing
their labels/names when they are prompted for, rather than selecting the
buttons within a buffer.  In contrast, activation of explicit buttons
depends upon the information on your screen since they are accessible
only from within their particular buffers.
</p>
<p>If you want a permanent link to a file section that you can follow at
any time, you can use a global button.  Or what about an Emacs keyboard
macro that you use frequently?  Create a global button with an action type
of <code class="code">exec-kbd-macro</code> button and an easy to type name.  Then you can
activate it whenever the need arises.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-C_002dh-h-g"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-menu_002c-Gbut"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-menu_002c-Global_002dButton"></a>
<p>Global buttons are managed with the Hyperbole Gbut/ menu accessed with
<kbd class="kbd">{C-h h g}</kbd>.  The Create item, <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h g c}</kbd>, prompts for a
global button name, an action type, and the action&rsquo;s associated
arguments, such as a file to which to link.  It then creates the button.
To activate the button, use the Act menu item, <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h g a}</kbd>.  Type
the button&rsquo;s name, press <kbd class="kbd">{<kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd>, and then Hyperbole prompts
you for its action type and associated arguments.  <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h g e}</kbd> to
edit an existing global button.  To remove a button, use the Delete menu
item, <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h g d}</kbd>; see <a class="pxref" href="#Deletion">Deletion</a>.
</p>
<p>Global buttons are actually explicit buttons stored at the end of your
personal button file, see <a class="pxref" href="#Button-Files">Button Files</a>.  You can always go into that
file and activate, edit or annotate these buttons with comments.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-bookmarks"></a>
<p>Emacs has a built-in feature similar to Global Buttons called
Bookmarks.  Bookmarks store places in files or link to URLs, so they
are more limited than Hyperbole&rsquo;s global buttons and cannot utilize
all of Hyperbole&rsquo;s capabilities for performing actions.  Hyperbole has
an action type, <code class="code">link-to-bookmark</code>, for using an Emacs bookmark
as a Hyperbole button referent.  See <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Bookmarks">Bookmarks</a> in <cite class="cite">the Emacs
Manual</cite>, for details on bookmarks.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-button_002c-implicit-1"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-implicit-button-1"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-link_002dto_002dfile"></a>
<p><em class="dfn">Implicit buttons</em> are virtual buttons recognized within the natural
structure of a document.  For example, a web URL button that displays its link
or an email address button that starts a mail message to the associated
address.  Implicit buttons are identified by implicit button type contextual
pattern matchers that identify appropriate textual patterns at point.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-implicit-button-type"></a>
<p>An <em class="dfn">implicit button type</em> utilizes Emacs Lisp to identify a pattern or
state that when matched triggers an <em class="emph">action</em> associated with the implicit
button type.  The action is specified by either a Hyperbole action type
(see <a class="pxref" href="#Action-Types">Action Types</a>) or an Emacs Lisp command.  Implicit button types may use
the same action types that explicit buttons use.  As an example, the pathname
implicit button type matches to any existing local filename or directory name
and its action type, <code class="code">link-to-file</code>, displays the associated file or
directory, typically in another window.  An explicit button could do the same
thing but has to be created manually, rather than recognized as part of the
buffer text.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-file_002c-hibtypes_002eel"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-context"></a>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-C_002dh-h-i-a"></a>
<p>Unlike explicit buttons, implicit buttons have no individual button
data other than their text and optional labels.  You use implicit
button types which include boolean expressions (predicates) that match
to both the label and the context required of any button of the type.
Each time a Smart Key is pressed at a location, Hyperbole evaluates
the predicates from the list of implicit button types and the first
one that evaluates true is selected and its associated action is
triggered.  Alternatively, you can use the Ibut/Act menu
item, <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h i a}</kbd>, to activate any implicit button found at the
current point.
</p>
<p>All of this happens transparently and is easy to use once you try it.
The Hyperbole Smart Keys offer additional extensive context-sensitive
point-and-click type behavior beyond implicit button types.  See <a class="xref" href="#Smart-Key-Operations">Smart Key Operations</a>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-implicit-button-labels"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-implicit-button-names"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-labeling-implicit-buttons"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-naming-implicit-buttons"></a>
<p>Individual implicit buttons may be labeled/named, allowing activation
by name or use as a link target by other buttons.  Here is a pathname
button with a label of &rsquo;My Emacs Files&rsquo;:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">&lt;[My Emacs Files]&gt;: &quot;~/.emacs.d&quot;
</pre></div>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-C_002dh-h-i-e"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-C_002dh-h-i-l"></a>
<p>The label is delimited by &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;[</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">]&gt;</samp>&rsquo; and can be followed
by any number of :, - or = separator characters, including none.  You
can activate the button either from its label or its text.  With point
on the text of an implicit button, <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h i l}</kbd> will label it.  Or
you may simply type the label and delimiters manually.  You can also
simply edit any implicit button manually but for a little more help in
editing named implicit buttons, use <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h i e}</kbd> which prompts
you to rename the button and to change its text (the button itself).

but it behaves similarly, so it is documented here.
</p>
<p>Hyperbole recognizes Org mode constructs in any of these modes:
<code class="code">org-mode</code>, <code class="code">org-agenda-mode</code>, <code class="code">outshine-mode</code>
or <code class="code">poporg-mode</code>.  (See the function <code class="code">hsys-org-mode-p</code>).
</p>
<p>Hyperbole does quite a few things for Org mode users.  When the Action
Key is pressed:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li> If on an Org todo keyword, cycle through the keywords in
that set or if final done keyword, remove it.

</li><li> If on an Org agenda item, jump to the item for editing.

</li><li> Within a radio or internal target or a link to it, jump between
the target and the first link to it, allowing two-way navigation.

</li><li> Follow other internal links in Org mode files.

</li><li> Follow Org mode external links.

</li><li> When on a Hyperbole button, activate the button.

</li><li> With point on the :dir path of a code block definition, display the
directory given by the path.

</li><li> With point on any #+BEGIN_SRC, #+END_SRC, #+RESULTS, #+begin_example
or #+end_example header, execute the code block via the Org mode
standard binding of <kbd class="kbd">{C-c C-c}</kbd>, <code class="code">org-ctrl-c-ctrl-c</code>.

</li><li> When point is on an Org mode heading, cycle the view of the subtree
at point.

</li><li> In any other context besides the end of a line, invoke the Org mode
standard binding of <kbd class="kbd">{M-<kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd>, <code class="code">org-meta-return</code>.
</li></ol>

<p>When the Assist Key is pressed, it behaves just like the Action Key
except in these contexts:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li> If on an Org todo keyword, move to the first todo keyword in
the next set, if any.

</li><li> If on an Org mode link or agenda item, display Hyperbole
context-sensitive help.

</li><li> On a Hyperbole button, performs the Assist Key function, generally
showing help for the button.

</li><li> With point on the :dir value of a code block definition, display
a help summary of this implicit directory button.

</li><li> With point on any #+BEGIN_SRC, #+END_SRC, #+RESULTS, #+begin_example
or #+end_example header, remove any associated results.

</li><li> Not on a Hyperbole button but on an Org mode heading, cycle
through views of the whole buffer outline.

e.g. <samp class="file">::</samp> represent the current directory, <samp class="file">.</samp>.  Must have at

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-action-button-1"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-implicit-action-button"></a>
<p>Explicit buttons all use the same syntax and store their action data
in a file separate from the button source file.  Implicit buttons have
no external data but use a unique syntax per implicit button type to
recognize the action to run.
</p>
<p>For times when you need a cross between the two, with a universal
button syntax and all button data stored in the button source file,
there are <em class="emph">action buttons</em>.
</p>
<p><em class="dfn">Action Buttons</em> are a form of implicit buttons that can execute
any existing action types, Emacs Lisp functions or display the values
of Emacs Lisp variables and constants.  Such buttons are delimited by
angle brackets, &lt; &gt;, and come in three types:
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><em class="dfn">action type invocations</em></dt>
<dd><p>These begin with an action type name (from the list displayed by
<kbd class="kbd">{C-h h d t a <kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd>) and are followed by any needed arguments
to form the action, e.g.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">&lt;link-to-file-line &quot;${hyperb:dir}/hact.el&quot; 40&gt;
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><em class="dfn">function calls</em></dt>
<dd><p>These are similar to action type invocations but begin with an Emacs
Lisp function name rather than an action type name, e.g.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">&lt;find-file-other-window &quot;/tmp&quot;&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Generally, such functions are invoked for their side-effects and their
return value is silently ignored.  But if a function is a boolean
predicate whose name ends in &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-p</samp>&rsquo;, then the result is displayed
in the minibuffer.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><em class="dfn">variable displays</em></dt>
<dd><p>These consist of an Emacs Lisp variable name only.  They display
messages with their variable name and value, e.g.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">&lt;fill-column&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>If there is a function binding with the same name as the variable you
wish to display, to prevent interpretation as a function call
action button, precede the name with a <code class="code">$</code>, e.g.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">&lt;$fill-column&gt;
</pre></div>

</dd>
</dl>

<p>With action buttons you need not remember any special syntax for each
type of implicit button.  You can freely embed them in any type of
text and use the Action and Assist keys on them as you do with any
other type of implicit button.
</p>
<p>An action button is recognized only if the first name within the angle
brackets is an existing action type or Emacs Lisp symbol.  Otherwise,
other implicit button types will be tested and may activate instead.
</p>
<p>To activate a frequently used action button by name independent of
your current buffer, simply add it to your global button file and
precede it with a label <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h i l}</kbd>.  Then invoke it by label
name with: <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h g a}</kbd>.

<h3 class="section" id="Button-Files-1">4.4 Button Files</h3>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-button-files"></a>
<p>It is often convenient to create files filled with buttons as a means
of navigating distributed information pools or for other purposes.
These files can also serve as useful roadmaps that guide a user
through both unfamiliar and highly familiar information spaces.  Files
that are created specifically for this purpose are
called <em class="dfn">Hyperbole button files</em>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hbmap_003afilename"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-button-file_002c-personal"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-button-file_002c-directory"></a>
<p>The Hyperbole menu system provides quick access to two types of these
button files: personal and directory-specific, through the ButFile menu.
(The variable, <code class="code">hbmap:filename</code>, contains the base name of these
button files.  Its standard value is <samp class="file">HYPB</samp>.)
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-dir_002c-_007e_002f_002ehyperb"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hbmap_003adir_002duser"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-global-button-2"></a>
<p>A personal button file may serve as a user&rsquo;s own roadmap to frequently
used resources, like a personal home page.  Selection of the
ButFile/PersonalFile menu item, <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h b p}</kbd>, displays this file for
editing.  The default personal button file is stored within the
directory given by the <code class="code">hbmap:dir-user</code> variable whose standard
value is <samp class="file">~/.hyperb</samp>.  The default Hyperbole configuration also
appends all global buttons to the end of this file, one per line, as
they are created.  So you can edit or annotate them within the file.
</p>
<p>A directory-specific button file may exist for each file system
directory.  Such files are useful for explaining the contents of
directories and pointing readers to particular highlights within the
directories.  Selection of the ButFile/DirFile menu item, <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h
b d}</kbd>, displays the button file for the current directory; this
provides an easy means of updating this file when working on a file
within the same directory.  If you want to view some other
directory-specific button file, simply use the normal Emacs file
finding commands.
</p>
<p>If you want group and site-specific button files, simply place links
to such files at the top of your personal button file and do so for
your colleagues.  This provides a flexible means of connecting to
such resources.

<p><em class="dfn">Action types</em> are Emacs Lisp commands that specify Hyperbole
button behaviors.  Hyperbole includes a useful set of action types
defined within their own namespace and created with the <code class="code">defact</code>
macro.  See the Hyperbole file, <samp class="file">hactypes.el</samp>, for examples of
how to define your own Hyperbole action types.
</p>
<p>Each action type may be used by any category of button: global,
explicit, or implicit.  The arguments needed by an action type are
prompted for at button creation time or in the case of an implicit
button, computed when the button is activated.  During button
activation, the arguments are fed to the action type&rsquo;s body to achieve
the desired result.  This body is called the button <em class="dfn">action</em>.
</p>
<p>Hyperbole handles all of this processing transparently.  As a user, all
you need know is the set of action types that you can work with when
creating explicit or global buttons.

<p>Action types create a convenient way of specifying button behavior
without the need to know how to program.  Expert users who are familiar
with Emacs Lisp, however, may find that they often want to tailor button
actions in a variety of ways not easily captured within a type system.
In such cases, <code class="code">hui:ebut-prompt-for-action</code> should be set to
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">t</samp>&rsquo;.  This will cause Hyperbole to prompt for an action to override
the button&rsquo;s action type at each explicit button creation.  For those cases
where the action type is sufficient, a &lsquo;<samp class="samp">nil</samp>&rsquo; value should be
entered for the action.  An action may be any Lisp form that Emacs
Lisp can evaluate.

<p>Explicit buttons always take precedence over implicit buttons.  Thus, if
a button selection is made which falls within both an explicit and
implicit button, only the explicit button will be selected.  Explicit
button labels are not allowed to overlap; Hyperbole&rsquo;s behavior in such
cases is undefined.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-ibtype_002c-evaluation-order"></a>
<p>If there is no explicit button at point during a selection request,
then each implicit button type predicate is tested in turn until one
returns non-nil or all are exhausted.  Since two implicit button types
may have overlapping <em class="dfn">domains</em>, those contexts in which their
predicates are true, only the first matching type is used.  The type
predicates are tested in <em class="emph">reverse</em> order of definition, i.e.
most recently entered types are tested first, so that personal types
defined after standard system types take precedence.  It is important
to keep this order in mind when defining new implicit button types.
By making match predicates as specific as possible, one can minimize
any overlapping implicit button domains.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-type-redefinition"></a>
<p>Once a type name is defined, its precedence relative to other types
remains the same even if its body is redefined, as long as its name is
not changed.  This allows incremental modifications to types without
any worry of altering their precedences.  See <a class="xref" href="#Creating-Types">Creating Types</a>, for
information on how to develop or modify types.

<p>Creating explicit buttons is fun and easy.  You can always try them
out immediately after creating them or can utilize the Assist Key to
verify what buttons do.  There are two ways to create them: by
dragging between windows with the Action Mouse Key or by using the
Hyperbole menus.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Action-Key-drag"></a>
<p>The most efficient way to create an explicit link button interactively
is to use the Action Mouse Key to drag from a non-read-only button
source window to a window showing its desired link referent.  More
specifically, you should split your current Emacs frame into two
windows: one which contains the point at which you want a button to be
inserted and another which shows the point to which you want to link.
Depress the Action Mouse Key at the source point for the button
(anywhere but on a paired delimiter such as double quotes or
parentheses).  Then drag to the other window and release the Action
Mouse Key at the start point of the link referent.  The process
becomes quite simple with a little practice. (See <a class="xref" href="#By-Menu">Creation
Via Menus</a>, for a more detailed explanation of the explicit button
creation process).
</p>
<p>If a region was selected prior to the start of the drag, it is used as
the button label, otherwise, you are prompted for the label.  Then
Hyperbole uses the link referent context to determine the type of link to
make.  If there are a few different types of links which are applicable
from the context, you will be prompted with a list of the types.  Simply
use the Action Key or the first capital letter of the link type to select
one of the type names and to finish the link creation.  Hyperbole will
then insert explicit button delimiters around the button label and will
display a message in the minibuffer indicating the button label, its
action/link type, and any arguments, notably the thing to which it links.
</p>
<p>The following table shows the type of link that will be created based
upon the referent context in which the Action Key is released.

<h4 class="subsubsection" id="Creation-Via-Menus">4.7.1.2 Creation Via Menus</h4>

<p>You may instead use the Hyperbole menus to create explicit buttons.
First, mark a short region of text in any fashion allowed by Emacs
and then select the Hyperbole menu item sequence, Ebut/Create.  You will
be prompted for the button&rsquo;s label with the marked region as the
default.  If you accept the default and enter the rest of the
information you are prompted for, the button will be created within the
current buffer and Hyperbole will surround the marked region with
explicit button delimiters to indicate success.
</p>
<p>If you do not mark a region before invoking the button create command,
you will be prompted for both a label and a target buffer for the button
and the delimited label text will be inserted into the target buffer
after a successful button creation.
</p>
<p>After Hyperbole has the button label and its target buffer, it will
prompt you for an action type for the button.  Use the <kbd class="kbd">{?}</kbd>
completion list key to see the available types.  The type selected
determines any following values for which you are prompted.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-button-instance"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-instance-number"></a>
<p>If a previous button with the same label exists in the same buffer,
Hyperbole will add an <em class="dfn">instance number</em> to the label when it adds
the delimiters so that the name is unique.  Thus, you don&rsquo;t have to
worry about accidental button name conflicts.  If you want the same
button to appear in multiple places within the buffer, just enter the
label again and delimit it yourself or copy and paste the button with
its delimiters.  Hyperbole will interpret all occurrences of the same
delimited label within a buffer as the same button.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-link_002c-creation"></a>
<p>If you create link buttons using the Hyperbole menus, the best
technique is to place on screen both the source buffer for the button
and the buffer to which it will link.  Mark the region of text to use
as your button label, invoke the button create command from the menu,
choose an action type which begins with <code class="code">link-to-</code> and then use
the direct selection techniques mentioned in <a class="ref" href="#Smart-Key-Argument-Selection">Smart Key Argument Selection</a>, to select the link referent.

<p>Once an explicit button has been created, its label text must be
treated specially.  Any inter-word spacing within the label may be
freely changed, as may happen when a paragraph is refilled, but a
special command must be invoked to rename it.
</p>
<p>The rename command operates in two different ways.  If point is within
a button label when it is invoked, it will tell you to edit the button
label and then to invoke the rename command again after the edit.  The
second invocation will actually rename the button.  If instead the
command is originally invoked outside of any explicit button, it will
prompt for the button label to replace and the label to replace it
with and then will perform the renaming.  All occurrences of the same
button in the buffer will be renamed.

<p>The rename command may be invoked from the Hyperbole menu via

<kbd class="kbd">{C-h w hui:ebut-rename <kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd> will show what if any key is bound

<p>Ebut/Delete works similarly to the Rename command but deletes the
selected button.  The button&rsquo;s delimiters are removed to confirm the
deletion.  If the delete command is invoked with a prefix argument, then
both the button label and the delimiters are removed as confirmation.

<p>Presently there is no way to recover a deleted button; it must

prefer no confirmation.

list may be activated as usual.  An Action Key press on the surrounding
context jumps to the associated source line.  A press on the filename
preceding the matches jumps to the file without selecting a particular
line.
</p>
<p>There are presently no user-level facilities for globally locating
buttons created by others or for searching on particular button
attributes.

<p>Hyperbole supports embedding buttons within electronic mail messages
composed in Emacs.  An enhanced mail reader may then be used to
activate the buttons within messages just like any other buttons.
Because this involves complex changes to mail support functions, this
feature is disabled by default.  Use the Cust/Msg-Toggle-Ebuts
minibuffer menu item to enable it.

<p>Hyperbole supports the following mail readers: Rmail (see <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Rmail">Reading
Mail with Rmail</a> in <cite class="cite">the GNU Emacs Manual</cite>), VM (see <a data-manual="vm" href="vm.html#Introduction">Introduction</a> in <cite class="cite">the VM Manual</cite>) and MH-e.  Button inclusion and activation within USENET news
articles is also supported in the same fashion via the Gnus news reader if
available at your site (see <a data-manual="gnus" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/gnus.html#Top">The Gnus Newsreader</a> in <cite class="cite">the Gnus
Manual</cite>).  (The <samp class="file">hmail.el</samp> file defines a generalized interface that can
be used to hook in other mail or news readers if the necessary interface
functions are written.)
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-mail_002dyank_002doriginal"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-C_002dc-C_002dy"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-mail-inclusion"></a>
<p>All explicit buttons to be mailed must be created within the outgoing
message buffer. There is no present support for including text from
other buffers or files which contain explicit buttons, except for the
ability to yank the contents of a message being replied to, together
with all of its buttons, via the <code class="code">(mail-yank-original)</code> command
bound to <kbd class="kbd">{C-c C-y}</kbd>.  From a user&rsquo;s perspective, buttons are
created in precisely the same way as in any other buffer.  They also
appear just like any other buttons to both the message sender and the
reader who uses the Hyperbole enhanced readers.  Button operation may be
tested any time before a message is sent.  A person who does not use
Hyperbole enhanced mail readers can still send messages with embedded
buttons since mail composing is independent of any mail reader
choice.
</p>
<p>Hyperbole buttons embedded within received mail messages behave as do
any other buttons.  The mail does not contain any of the action type
definitions used by the buttons, so the receiver must have these or
she will receive an error when she activates the buttons.  Buttons
which appear in message <em class="emph">Subject</em> lines are copied to summary
buffers whenever such summaries are generated.  Thus, they may be
activated from either the message or the summary buffers.
</p>
<p>Nothing bad will happen if a mail message with explicit buttons is sent
to a non-Hyperbole user.  The user will simply see the text
of the message followed by a series of lines of button data at its end.
Hyperbole mail users never see this data in its raw form.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-smail_003acomment"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-mail-comment"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Hyperbole-mail-comment"></a>
<p>In order to alert readers of your mail messages that you can handle
Hyperbole mail buttons, you can set the variable, <code class="code">smail:comment</code>,
to an expression that automatically inserts a comment into each
outgoing message to announce this fact.  See its documentation for
technical details.  By default, no comment is added.  To have a
comment line added to your outgoing message, add the following to
to your <samp class="file">~/.emacs</samp> file before the point at which you load
Hyperbole.
</p>
<div class="example lisp">
<pre class="lisp-preformatted">(setq smail:comment
 (format &quot;Comments: GNU Hyperbole mail buttons accepted, v%s.\n&quot;
          hyperb:version))
</pre></div>

<p>This will produce the following line in outgoing messages:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">Comments: GNU Hyperbole mail buttons accepted, vX.X.X.
</pre></div>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-file_002c-_002eemacs-2"></a>
<p>where the X&rsquo;s indicate your Hyperbole version number.  You can cut
this out of particular messages before you send them when need be.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-actype_002c-link_002dto_002dmail"></a>
<p>A final mail-related facility provided by Hyperbole is the ability to
save a pointer to a received mail message by creating an explicit button
with a <code class="code">link-to-mail</code> action type.  When prompted for the mail
message to link to, if you press the Action Key within the message, the
appropriate link parameters will be copied to the argument prompt, as
described in <a class="ref" href="#Smart-Key-Argument-Selection">Smart Key Argument Selection</a>.

<p>Explicit buttons may be embedded within outgoing USENET news articles
and may be activated from within the Gnus news reader.  Because this
involves complex changes to news support functions, this feature is
disabled by default.  Use the Cust/Msg-Toggle-Ebuts minibuffer menu
item to enable it (enabling it for mail also enables it for news and
vice versa).
</p>
<p>Once enabled, all Hyperbole support should work just as it does when
reading or sending mail.  See <a class="xref" href="#Buttons-in-Mail">Buttons in Mail</a>.  When reading news,
buttons which appear in message <em class="emph">Subject</em> lines may be activated
within the Gnus subject buffer as well as the article buffer.  When
posting news, the *post-news* buffer is used for outgoing news
articles rather than a mail-related buffer.
</p>
<p>Remember that the articles you post do not contain the action type
definitions used by the buttons, so the receiver must have these or she
will receive an error when she activates the buttons.  You should also
keep in mind that most USENET readers will not be using Hyperbole, so if
they receive a news article containing explicit buttons, they will
wonder what the button data at the end of the message is.  You should
therefore limit distribution of such messages.  For example, if most
people at your site read news with Gnus and use Hyperbole, it would be
reasonable to embed buttons in postings to local newsgroups.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-news-comment"></a>
<p>In order to alert readers of your postings that they may send you
personal replies with embedded Hyperbole buttons, the system inserts
into news postings the same comment that is included within mail
messages, if enabled.  See <a class="xref" href="#Buttons-in-Mail">Buttons in Mail</a>, for details and an
explanation of how to turn this feature on.

<p>Pulldown and popup menus are available to invoke Hyperbole commands,
including those from the HyRolo and the Koutliner.  These menus operate
like any other application menus and are fairly self-explanatory.  Use
the <code class="code">Remove-This-Menu</code> command on the Hyperbole menubar menu to
get rid of the menu if you do not need it.  Invoking Hyperbole from
the keyboard, as explained below, will add the menu back to the
menubar.  Here is the Hyperbole Menubar Menu and its Find submenu.

<p>The Hyperbole popup menu, <code class="code">hyperbole-popup-menu</code>, replicates the
Hyperbole menubar menu.  It can be bound to a mouse key but is not
bound to one by default.   It can also be assigned as the default
Action or Assist Key action to use when no matching context is found.

<p>The rest of this section discusses only the
specialized <em class="dfn">minibuffer menus</em> which appear in the minibuffer
window and work with all emacs versions on all display devices.  They
provide similar capabilities to those of the Hyperbole menubar but
additionally allow for fast menu item selection via the keyboard or
mouse.  When used with the keyboard, they provide command access
similar to key bindings.  In fact, any menu item can be bound to a
global key sequence.  See <a class="xref" href="#Binding-Minibuffer-Menu-Items">Binding Minibuffer Menu Items</a>.

{<kbd class="key">TAB</kbd>} or <kbd class="kbd">{M-f}</kbd> to move forward an item, <kbd class="kbd">{Shift-<kbd class="key">TAB</kbd>}</kbd>
or <kbd class="kbd">{M-b}</kbd> to move backward an item and {<kbd class="key">RET</kbd>} to select the
current item.  A press of the Assist Key on an item displays help for the
item, including the action that it performs.  &quot;/&quot; at the end of an item name

<p>Hyperbole includes the fastest, easiest-to-use Emacs window and frame
management system available, HyControl, found under the Hyperbole
Screen menu.  If you use a lot of Emacs windows or frames (typically,
window system windows) then this chapter is for you.
</p>
<p>HyControl interactively adjusts the layout of your windows and frames
down to the pixel-level if desired.  You adjust the location, size and
display elements of your windows and frames until they look as you like
and then simply quit HyControl and go back to work.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-C_002dc-_005c"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-screen_002c-C_002dc-_005c"></a>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-menu-item_002c-FramesControl"></a>
<p>Hyperbole binds the key <kbd class="kbd">{C-c \}</kbd> for quick access to HyControl&rsquo;s
window control menu, if it was not already bound prior to Hyperbole&rsquo;s
initialization; otherwise, the Screen/WindowsControl minibuffer menu
item, <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h s w}</kbd>, will do the same thing.  To start HyControl
with the frames menu instead, use Screen/FramesControl, <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h s
f}</kbd>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-submodes"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-screen_002c-t"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-screen_002c-q"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-screen_002c-Q"></a>
<p>Once in HyControl, your minibuffer window at the bottom of the
selected frame will display a summary of keys you may use to adjust
your windows until you press <kbd class="kbd">{q}</kbd> or <kbd class="kbd">{Q}</kbd> to quit from
HyControl.  The key, <kbd class="kbd">{t}</kbd>, will always toggle between controlling
frames and windows, the <em class="dfn">submodes</em> of HyControl, with the upper
left of the minibuffer prompt showing which type of control is active.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-numeric-argument"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-multiplier"></a>
<p>A number of commands take a single numeric argument, e.g. movement and
sizing, which you can enter by typing a period to clear the argument,
followed by any positive number up to 1000.  You may also use
the <kbd class="kbd">{C-u}</kbd> universal argument key to apply a multiplier of 4 to
the argument, any number of times.  Any entry that pushes the argument
over 1000, restarts it, so 10005 would produce an argument of 5.
</p>
<p>The table below explains what each key does in HyControl mode.  If the
explanation does not say otherwise, then the key applies in both window
and frame submodes.

<p>Display a <em class="dfn">grid of windows</em> in the selected frame sized according to
the prefix argument or via a prompted input.  Left digit of the argument is
the number of grid rows and the right digit is the number of grid columns
to display.  The buffers displayed in the grid are determined by the value
of the prefix argument given to the command or by the selected items in the
current window if in Buffer Menu, Ibuffer Menu or Dired mode.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hycontrol_002ddisplay_002dbuffer_002dpredicate_002dlist"></a>
<p>With no prefix argument and no items chosen, the selected frame&rsquo;s buffer list
is filtered through <code class="code">hycontrol-display-buffer-predicate-list</code>, a list of
predicate/boolean filter functions.  The default predicate selects existing
buffers with attached files and displays those.
</p>
<div class="float" id="image_003a2x3_002dWindows_002dGrid">

<div class="caption"><p><strong class="strong">Image 6.1: </strong>2x3 Windows Grid</p></div></div><br>

<p>With a prefix argument of 0, the user is prompted for a major mode name and
the windows grid size.  Only those buffers with the named major mode are
displayed.
</p>
<p>With a prefix argument &lt; 0, the user is prompted for a shell glob-type file
pattern; matching files are read into buffers and displayed in an auto-sized
windows grid.
</p>
<p>Otherwise, when the prefix argument is an invalid size, the windows grid
command prompts for the grid size.
</p>
<p>When done, this resets the persistent prefix argument to 1 to prevent
following commands from using the often large grid size argument.
</p>





<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hycontrol_002dwindow_002dgrid_002drepeatedly"></a>
<p>If you ever need to experiment with different sized window grids, use
<kbd class="kbd">{M-x hycontrol-window-grid-repeatedly <kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd>.  It will
repeatedly prompt you for a grid size and then display it.  When you
are done, simply press <kbd class="kbd">{<kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd> to exit.

<p>Programmatically, there are a number of ways to generate and display a windows grid.
<code class="code">hycontrol-windows-grid-by-file-pattern</code> creates a windows grid from a glob file

<br>
<p>The rest of this section goes into some technicalities about HyControl
settings.  You may ignore it if you are not familiar with Emacs
variables and functions or with customized Emacs.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-HyControl-edge-placement"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-HyControl-corner-placement"></a>
<p>HyControl allows placement of frames at screen edges and corners with the
frame cycle command, <kbd class="kbd">{c}</kbd>, and direct placement using the layout of the
numeric keypad keys, if available, or the <kbd class="kbd">p</kbd> virtual keypad key
otherwise.  (Note that a screen may span multiple physical monitors).
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-HyControl-screen-edge-offsets"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-screen_002c-edge-offsets"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hycontrol_002dscreen_002doffset_002dalist"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hycontrol_002dset_002dscreen_002doffsets"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hycontrol_002dget_002dscreen_002doffsets"></a>
<p>To prevent widgets and toolbars at the corners of the screen from
being obscured, HyControl can offset each frame from each screen edge
by a fixed number of pixels.  These offsets are specified by the
variable,<code class="code">hycontrol-screen-offset-alist</code> and can differ for each type of
screen; see its documentation for details.  If you change its value,
then call <code class="code">hycontrol-set-screen-offsets</code> to set any new offset
values.  <code class="code">hycontrol-get-screen-offsets</code> returns the list of offsets
in clockwise order starting from the top edge.  Both functions display a
minibuffer message with the current offsets when called interactively.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hycontrol_002dframe_002doffset-1"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-frame_002c-make"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-make-frame"></a>
<p>When HyControl creates a new frame, it automatically sizes it to the
same size as the previously selected frame and offsets it from that
frame by the (X . Y) number of pixels given in the variable,
<code class="code">hycontrol-frame-offset</code>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-file_002c-hycontrol_002eel"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hycontrol_002denable_002dframes_002dmode"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hycontrol_002denable_002d_002dwindows_002dmode"></a>
<p>The source code for the HyControl system is in <samp class="file">hycontrol.el</samp>
within your Hyperbole source directory, given by <code class="code">hyperb:dir</code>.
HyControl uses standard Emacs keymaps, so any keys can be rebound.
Remember that Hyperbole typically binds <kbd class="kbd">{C-c \}</kbd> to the windows
control menu, but if you would like to bind either of the two
HyControl minor mode invocation commands to keys, they are,
<code class="code">hycontrol-enable-windows-mode</code> and <code class="code">hycontrol-enable-frames-mode</code>.
Generally, you need only one of these bound to a key since when you
press that key, the other command can be reached by pressing <kbd class="kbd">{t}</kbd>.

<p>The Hyperbole outliner, the Koutliner (pronounced Kay-outliner),
produces structured, autonumbered documents composed of hierarchies of
cells.  Each <em class="dfn">cell</em> has two identifiers, a
<em class="dfn">relative identifier</em> indicating its present position within the
outline and a <em class="dfn">permanent identifier</em> called an <em class="dfn">idstamp</em>,
suitable for use within hyperlink references to the cell.  The idstamp
is typically not displayed but is available when needed.
See <a class="xref" href="#Autonumbering">Autonumbering</a>.
</p>
<p>Cells also store their time of creation and the user who created the
cell.  User-defined attributes may also be added to cells.  See <a class="xref" href="#Cell-Attributes">Cell Attributes</a>.

file, as pictured on the following page.  It is an actual outline file
that explains major outliner operations.  You can test out the viewing,
editing and motion commands with this file since a personal copy is made
when you invoke this command.  If you have already edited this file and
want to start with a fresh one, give the command a prefix argument:
<kbd class="kbd">{C-u C-h h k e}</kbd>.

<p>When a new koutline is created, an invisible root cell is added.  Its
permanent and relative ids are both 0, and it is considered to be at
level 0 in the outline.  All visible cells in the outline are at level 1
or deeper, and thus are descendants of this root cell.  Some koutliner
commands prompt for cell numbers as arguments.  An argument of 0 makes
commands operate upon the entire outline.
</p>
<p>An initial level 1 cell is also created to make it easy to start
entering text in the outline.  A koutline always has at least one
visible cell in it.
</p>
<p>See <a class="xref" href="#Autonumbering">Autonumbering</a>, which explains how cells are labeled according to their
respective levels in the outline and how these labels are updated as the
structure of the outline changes.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-autonumber-1"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-relative-identifier"></a>
<p>See <a class="xref" href="#Adding-and-Killing">Adding and Killing</a>, for information on how to add new cells to or
remove cells from a koutline.  As you do this, or as you promote or
demote cells within the outline, the labels preceding the contents of
each cell automatically update to reflect the new structure.  These
labels are also known as <em class="dfn">autonumbers</em> and as <em class="dfn">relative ids</em>
because they change as the structure changes.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-outline-structure"></a>
<p>The outline structure is shown by these labels and by the indentation of
each outline level.  Normally, each deeper level is indented another
three characters, to reflect the nesting.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-label-type_002c-alpha"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-label-type_002c-legal"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-alpha-labels"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-legal-labels"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-outline_002c-label-type"></a>
<p>The default autonumbers are called <em class="dfn">alphanumeric labels</em> because
they alternate between using numbers and letters to distinguish each
successive level.  Each alphanumeric label uniquely identifies a cell&rsquo;s
position in an outline, so that there is no need to scan back to prior
cells to see what the current section number of an outline is.  This is
similar to a legal numbering scheme but without all the period
characters between level numbers.  As an example, 1b3 is equivalent to a
legal label of 1.2.3.  Both refer to the 3rd cell at level 3,
below the 2nd child of the first cell at level 1.  Said another way,
this is the 3rd child of the 1st cell&rsquo;s 2nd child.  In other words, it
is easier to visualize hierarchies than to talk about them.
</p>
<p>Alphanumeric labels are the default because they are shorter and easier
to read aloud than equivalent legal ones.  They also simplify
distinguishing between even and odd level labels because of the
alternating character set.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-koutliner_002c-C_002dc-C_002dl"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-label-type_002c-changing"></a>
<p>You can change the labeling scheme used in a particular outline with
the command <kbd class="kbd">{C-c C-l}</kbd>.  A <kbd class="kbd">{?}</kbd> will show all of the
labeling options.  The default, alpha labels, legal labels, and
permanent idstamps (permanent cell ids) are all available.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-label-separator_002c-changing"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-cell-label-separator"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-outline-label-separator"></a>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-koutliner_002c-C_002du-C_002dc-M_002dl"></a>
<p>A cell label is normally followed by a period and a space, called the
<em class="dfn">label separator</em>, prior to the start of the cell contents.  You can
change the separator for the current outline with <kbd class="kbd">{C-c M-l}</kbd>.
<kbd class="kbd">{C-u C-c M-l}</kbd> will additionally change the default separator
value used when new outlines are created (for the current session only).
For example, use the value &quot;  &quot; (two spaces) to get eliminate the
trailing period after each cell label.  The separator must be at least
two characters long but may be longer.

<p>Idstamps (permanent ids) are associated with each cell.  They maintain
hyperlinks as cells are reordered within a koutline.  See <a class="xref" href="#Klinks">Klinks</a>.
Idstamps may be displayed in place of the outline level relative ids.
Use <kbd class="kbd">{C-c C-l id <kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-idstamp-counter"></a>
<p>An idstamp counter for each outline starts at 0 and is incremented by
one each time a cell is added to the outline.  This idstamp stays with
the cell no matter where it is moved within the outline.  If the cell is
deleted, its idstamp is not reused.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-cell_002c-idstamp-0-1"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-idstamp-0"></a>
<p>The 0 idstamp is always assigned to the root node of the entire outline.
This node is never visible within the outline, but is used so that the
outline may be treated as a single tree when needed.  Idstamps always
begin with a 0, as in 012, to distinguish them from relative ids.

<p>Text editing within the Koutliner works just as it does for other
buffers, except when you need to deal with the structural components of
an outline.  Within the contents of a cell, all of your standard editing
keys should work properly.  You can just type in text and the left and
right margins of the lines will be maintained for you.  See <a class="xref" href="#Filling">Filling</a>,
for the times when you need to refill a paragraph or to control when
filling occurs.
</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t invoke editing commands with <kbd class="kbd">{M-x command-name <kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd>
since the Koutliner uses differently named commands made to act
like the regular editing commands.  Koutliner commands, however, account
for the structure and indentation in koutlines.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-cell-selection"></a>
<p>You may use the mouse to select parts of the contents of a single cell
for editing.  But don&rsquo;t drag across cell boundaries and then edit the
selected region, since that will destroy the outline structure.

<p>Trees may be demoted or promoted by pressing <kbd class="key">TAB</kbd> or
<kbd class="kbd">{M-<kbd class="key">TAB</kbd>}</kbd> (or <kbd class="kbd">{<kbd class="key">SHIFT</kbd>-<kbd class="key">TAB</kbd>}</kbd>) respectively, as
in most outliners today.  <kbd class="kbd">{M-0 <kbd class="key">TAB</kbd>}</kbd> and <kbd class="kbd">{M-0
M-<kbd class="key">TAB</kbd>}</kbd> demote and promote trees and additionally refill each
cell that is not specially marked to prevent refilling.
See <a class="xref" href="#Filling">Filling</a>.  A positive or negative prefix argument to these
commands promotes or demotes the tree up to a maximum of the number of
levels given by the argument.  The outline may not support movement of
the tree by the number of levels requested, however, in which case the
maximal possible adjustment is made.

<p><kbd class="kbd">{M-1 <kbd class="key">TAB</kbd>}</kbd> behaves specially.  It toggles the function of
<kbd class="key">TAB</kbd> and <kbd class="kbd">{M-<kbd class="key">TAB</kbd>}</kbd> so that they insert a tab
and remove the previous character, respectively.  This is useful when
one is formatting information within a single cell.  When in this
mode, <kbd class="kbd">{<kbd class="key">TAB</kbd>}</kbd> inserts a literal TAB character, by default.
Set the variable, <code class="code">kotl-mode:indent-tabs-mode</code>, to
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">nil</samp>&rsquo; if you want space characters used to form the tab.
Use <kbd class="kbd">{M-1 <kbd class="key">TAB</kbd>}</kbd> to toggle the <kbd class="key">TAB</kbd> and
<kbd class="kbd">{M-<kbd class="key">TAB</kbd>}</kbd> keys back to promoting and demoting trees.
</p>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Org-tables"></a>
<p>The Koutliner also supports Org Table editing, see <a data-manual="org" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/org.html#Tables">Tables</a> in <cite class="cite">the Org
Mode Manual</cite>, via Org table minor mode.  Use <kbd class="kbd">{M-x orgtbl-mode <kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd>
to toggle this on and off.  A press of the Action Key on a <code class="code">|</code> symbol,
also toggles this minor mode on or off.

<p>Tree demotion and promotion keys match the defaults in Org mode and
Outline mode, plus some easier to type ones.  The tables below
summarize which keys work whether inside an Org table or outside.
</p>
<p>Note that you must use <kbd class="kbd">{M-0 <kbd class="key">TAB</kbd>}</kbd> and <kbd class="kbd">{M-0 M-<kbd class="key">TAB</kbd>}</kbd> to
demote/promote Koutline trees when in a table since <kbd class="key">TAB</kbd> by itself
moves between fields within a table.

<p>Like Org mode, you can move the tree rooted at point past trees rooted
at the same level with <kbd class="kbd">{M-down}</kbd> and before trees with <kbd class="kbd">{M-up}</kbd>.
Give a prefix argument to move past that many other trees.  (A 0 valued
argument is automatically changed to 1).
</p>
<p>For maximum flexibility in rearranging outlines, there are commands
that move or copy entire trees anywhere within the outline as
described in the table below.  Each of these commands prompts for the
label of the root cell to move or copy and for a second cell which
specifies the new location for the moved or copied tree.  You may
either accept the default provided, type in the cell label, or when a
mouse is available, simply double click with the Action Key on the
contents of a cell.  The Koutliner knows to use the cell&rsquo;s label in
such cases.
</p>
<p>In the following commands, words delimited with &lt;&gt; represent the
arguments for which each command prompts.  Note how the use of prefix
arguments changes each command&rsquo;s behavior from insertion at the sibling
level to insertion at the child level.

<p>For information on mode and suffix-specific conversions performed on
file elements before they are inserted, see the documentation for the
variables, <code class="code">kimport:mode-alist</code> and <code class="code">kimport:suffix-alist</code>.  This
same conversion process applies if you invoke <kbd class="kbd">{M-x kotl-mode
<kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd> in a non-koutline buffer or if you perform a generic file import
as described later in this section.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-kimport_003ainsert_002dfile_002dcontents"></a>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-C_002dh-h-k-f-f"></a>
<p>The outliner supports conversion of three types of files into koutline
files.  You can import a file into an existing koutline,
following the tree at point, or can create a new koutline from the
imported file contents.  <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h k f f}</kbd> or <kbd class="kbd">{M-x kimport:file <kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd>
selects the importation type based on the buffer or filename suffix of the
file to import.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-kotl_002dmode-1"></a>
<p>If you want to convert a buffer from some other mode into a koutline and
then want to save the converted buffer back to its original file,
thereby replacing the original format, use <kbd class="kbd">{M-x kotl-mode <kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd>.
Remember that you will lose the old format of the buffer when you do
this.
</p>
<p>Use one of the following commands when you need explicit control over
the type of importation used on some text.  With these commands, your
original file remains intact.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-kimport_003atext"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-text-file"></a>
<p>Use <kbd class="kbd">{M-x kimport:text <kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd> and you will be prompted for a text
buffer or file to import and the new koutline buffer or file to create
from its text.  Each paragraph will be imported as a separate cell, with
all imported cells at the same level, since indentation of paragraphs is
presently ignored.  This same command can be used to import the
contents, attributes and level structure of cells from another koutline.

<p>Star outlines are standard emacs outlines where each entry begins with
one or more asterisk characters.  Use <kbd class="kbd">{M-x kimport:star-outline
<kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd> and you will be prompted for the star outline buffer or
file to import and the new koutline buffer or file to create.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Augment-outline"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-kimport_003aaug_002dpost_002doutline"></a>
<p>(Skip this if you are unfamiliar with the Augment/NLS system originally
created at SRI.)  Files exported from the Augment system as text often
have alphanumeric statement identifiers on the right side.  You can
import such files while maintaining their outline structure.  Use
<kbd class="kbd">{M-x kimport:aug-post-outline <kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd> and you will be
prompted for the Augment buffer or file to import and the koutline to
create.  See <a class="url" href="https://dougengelbart.org/content/view/148/">https://dougengelbart.org/content/view/148/</a> for more

<p><em class="dfn">View specifications</em> (view specs, for short) are short codes used
to control the view of a koutline.  The view specs in effect for an
outline are always displayed in the modeline of the outline&rsquo;s window,
following the outline buffer name, unless the variable,
<code class="code">kvspec:string</code>, has been set to &lsquo;<samp class="samp">nil</samp>&rsquo; to disable view spec
display.  The modeline display appears as &lt;|viewspec&gt; to aid rapid
visual location.  The | (pipe character) is also used in links that
specify view specs to indicate the start of a view spec sequence.
See <a class="xref" href="#Klinks">Klinks</a>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-outline_002c-view-specs"></a>
<p>The current view spec is saved whenever the outline is saved.  The next
time the outline is read in, the same view spec will be applied.
</p>
<p>The rest of this section documents the view spec characters that are
presently supported and explains how to invoke a view spec.  There is no
user-level means of adding your own view spec characters, so all other
character codes are reserved for future use.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-link"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hyperlink"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-klink-1"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-_003c_003e-delimiters"></a>
<p>Cells may include hyperlinks that refer to other cells or to external
sources of information.  Explicit Hyperbole buttons may be created as
usual with mouse drags (see <a class="pxref" href="#By-Dragging">Creation Via Action Key
Drags</a>).  Implicit Hyperbole buttons may be added to Koutline text as
well.  A <em class="dfn">klink</em> is a special implicit link button, delimited by
&lt;&gt; separators, that jumps to a koutline cell and may also adjust the
current outline viewspecs.  This section discusses klinks.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-klink_002c-formats"></a>
<p>There are three forms of klinks:
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dd><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-internal-klink"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-klink_002c-internal"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-_003c_0040-klink_003e"></a>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph">internal</em></dt>
<dd><p>&lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;@ 2b=06&gt;</samp>&rsquo; is an internal klink, since it refers to the koutline in
which it is embedded.  When activated, it jumps to the cell within the
current outline which has permanent id &lsquo;06&rsquo; and relative id
&lsquo;2b&rsquo;.  &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;@ 06&gt;</samp>&rsquo; does the same thing, as does &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;@ 2b&gt;</samp>&rsquo;,
though this latter form will not maintain the link properly if the
cell is moved elsewhere within the outline.  The form,
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;@ 2b=06 |ben&gt;</samp>&rsquo; additionally sets the view spec of the current
outline back to the default value, with a blank line between each cell
and the whole outline visible.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-external-klink"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-klink_002c-external"></a>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph">external</em></dt>
<dd><p>The second klink format is an external link to another koutline, such
as, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;EXAMPLE.kotl, 3=012 |c1e&gt;</samp>&rsquo;, which displays the named file,
starting at the cell 3 (whose permanent identifier is 012), with the
view specification of: blank lines turned off, cutoff after one line
per cell, and showing ellipses for cells or trees which are collapsed.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-klink_002c-view-spec"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-view-spec_002c-klink"></a>
</dd>
<dt><em class="emph">view spec</em></dt>
<dd><p>The third format sets a view spec for the current koutline.  For
example, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;|ben&gt;</samp>&rsquo;, when activated, sets the view in the current
outline to display blank lines, to use ellipses after collapsed lines
and to label cells with the alphanumeric style.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-koutliner_002c-Action-Key_002c-klink"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Action-Key_002c-klink"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-klink_002c-activating"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-klink-referent"></a>
<p>Press the Action Key over a klink to follow it.  This will flash the
klink as a button and then will display its referent in the other
window.  If the klink contains a view spec, it will be applied when
the referent is displayed.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-klink_002c-inserting"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-koutliner_002c-C_002dc-l"></a>
<p>There are a number of easy ways to insert klinks into koutlines.  If you
have mouse support under Hyperbole, simply click the Action Key within
the indentation to the left of a cell text.  If you then double click on
some cell, a link to that cell will be inserted where you started.  From
a keyboard, use <kbd class="kbd">{C-c l}</kbd> when in a koutline or <kbd class="kbd">{C-h h k l}</kbd> when
not in a koutline to insert a klink.  Since klinks are implicit buttons,
you may instead type in the text of the klink just as you saw them in the
examples above and they will work exactly as if they had been entered with
the insert link command.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-M_002dw"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-C_002dy"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-klink_002c-copying"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-klink_002c-yanking"></a>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-kotl_002dmode_003acopy_002dabsolute_002dklink_002dto_002dkill_002dring"></a>
<p>If you prefer the standard copy and yank model that Emacs provides, place
point within a klink when there is no active region and use <kbd class="kbd">{M-w}</kbd> to
copy the klink.  To instead copy a reference to the current Koutline cell,
use <kbd class="kbd">{M-w}</kbd> <em class="emph">outside of</em> a klink when no region is active or
<kbd class="kbd">{M-x kotl-mode:copy-absolute-klink-to-kill-ring <kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd> anywhere
within a cell.  Then <kbd class="kbd">{C-y}</kbd> will yank the last copied text into any
buffer you desire.  Of course, when a region is active, <kbd class="kbd">{M-w}</kbd> will
copy the region as it does normally in Emacs.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-C_002dx-r-i"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-C_002dx-r-s"></a>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-kotl_002dmode_003acopy_002dabsolute_002dklink_002dto_002dregister"></a>
<p>Similarly, you can copy to an Emacs register rather than the kill ring.
When no region is active/highlighted, <kbd class="kbd">{C-x r s}</kbd> prompts for an Emacs
register and saves to it either the current klink or, when outside of a
klink, a reference to the current cell.  <kbd class="kbd">{M-x
kotl-mode:copy-absolute-klink-to-register <kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd> anywhere within a cell
saves a reference to the current cell to a register.
</p>
<p><kbd class="kbd">{C-x r i}</kbd> with the same register then inserts at point the Koutline
reference previously saved.  When a region is active, these operate on the
region instead.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-cell-reference_002c-copying"></a>
<p>There are also commands not bound to keys that always copy a klink reference
to the current cell:
</p><div class="example">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">kotl-mode:copy-absolute-klink-to-kill-ring
kotl-mode:copy-relative-klink-to-kill-ring
kotl-mode:copy-absolute-klink-to-register
kotl-mode:copy-relative-klink-to-register
</pre></div></div>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-klink_003aignore_002dmodes"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-klink_003ac_002dstyle_002dmodes"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-modes-to-ignore-klinks"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-klinks_002c-ignoring"></a>
<p>Because klinks use a very generic syntax, surrounded by &lt;angle brackets&gt;,
in certain modes, mostly C-based programming modes, certain non-klink syntax
can be mistakenly identified as klinks.  Therefore, the Koutliner provides
two customizable variables which disable klink recognition in selected major
modes, <code class="code">klink:ignore-modes</code> and <code class="code">klink:c-style-modes</code>.  Add a mode
to one of these if you find any syntax that improperly registers as a klink.
</p>
<p><code class="code">klink:ignore-modes</code> is for non-programming modes, as Hyperbole ensures
that within all programming major modes, klinks are recognized only when point
is within a comment.
</p>
<p><code class="code">klink:c-style-modes</code> is rarely needed but is there if Hyperbole ever
mistakenly recognizes a pattern within a comment as a klink when it isn&rsquo;t.

<p>Much of the Hyperbole outliner design is based upon concepts pioneered
in the Augment/NLS system, <cite class="cite">[Eng84a]</cite>.  Augment treated documents as
a hierarchical set of nodes, called statements, rather than cells.
Every Augment document utilized this intrinsic structure.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-distributed-collaboration"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-collaboration"></a>
<p>The system could rapidly change the view of a document by collapsing,
expanding, generating, clipping, filtering, including or reordering
these nodes.  It could also map individual views to multiple workstation
displays across a network to aid in distributed, collaborative work.

convenient management of hierarchical, record-oriented information.
Most often this is used for contact management but it can quickly be
adapted to most any record-oriented lookup task requiring fast retrieval.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-rolo_002c-buttons-in"></a>
<p>Hyperbole buttons may be included within rolo records and then
manually activated whenever their records are retrieved in a search.
</p>
<p>The following subsections explain use and basic customization of this
tool.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-rolo-entry"></a>
<p>HyRolo manages and searches rolo files.  A <em class="dfn">rolo file</em> consists of
an optional header that starts and ends with a line of equal signs
(at least three equal signs starting at the beginning of a line),
followed by zero or more rolo records.  You must manually add a header
to any rolo file if you want it to have one.
</p>
<p>Here is an example of a simple rolo file.  The date at the end is
automatically added by HyRolo whenever a new record is added.
</p>
<div class="example">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">==================================================================
                          PERSONAL ROLO
&lt;Last-Name&gt;, &lt;First&gt;  &lt;Email&gt;        W&lt;Work#&gt;       F&lt;Fax#&gt;

*   Smith, John       &lt;js@hiho.com&gt; W708-555-2001  F708-321-1492

</pre></div></div>

<p>We call rolo records, <em class="dfn">entries</em>.  Entries begin with a delimiter
of one or more &lsquo;*&rsquo; characters at the beginning of a line.  Entries may
be arranged in a hierarchy, where child entries start with one more &lsquo;*&rsquo;
character than do their parents.  Top-level entries begin with a single
&lsquo;*&rsquo;.
</p>
<p>Beyond this initial delimiter, entries are completely free-form text.
It is best to use a &quot;lastname, firstname&quot; format, however, when adding
contact entries into a rolo.  Then HyRolo will automatically keep your
entries alphabetized as you enter them.  Then you can sort the entries
if you ever need.  This ordering is what the rolo will use if you
accept the default entry with which it prompts you when adding a new
entry.
</p>
<p>Any search done on the rolo scans the full text of each entry.  During
a search, the rolo file header separator lines and anything in between
are appended to the buffer of matched entries before any entries are
retrieved from the file.  Whenever an entry is matched, it and all of
its descendant entries are retrieved.  If your emacs version supports
textual highlighting, each search match is highlighted for quick,
visual location.
</p>
<p>For example, a search on &quot;Company&quot; could retrieve the following:
</p>
<div class="example">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">==================================================================
                        COMPANY ROLO
==================================================================
*    Company
**     Manager
***      Staffer
</pre></div></div>

<p>Thus, searching for Company retrieves all listed employees.
Searching for Manager turns up all Staffer entries.

=====================================================================
</pre></div></div>

<p>The &rsquo;File&rsquo; menu item displays and edits the first file listed in
<code class="code">hyrolo-file-list</code> unless given a prefix argument, in which case
it prompts with completion for the file to edit.
</p>
<p>A prefix argument used with any of the above menu items with &rsquo;Find&rsquo; in
their names limits the search to a maximum number of matches given by
the argument.  The search is terminated whenever that number of
matches is found.
</p>
<p>For any of the above commands that prompt for a HyRolo name, such as
Edit or Add (not the Find commands), you may use the form parent/child
to locate a child entry below a specific parent.  Hence, for a HyRolo
which looks like so:
</p>
<div class="example">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">*    Company
**     Manager
***      Staffer
</pre></div></div>

<p>you can refer to the Staffer entry with the following hierarchical
notation, Company/Manager/Staffer.  This hierarchical
notation is not used in search expressions since they search the
entire HyRolo anyway.  Thus, &quot;Staffer&quot; as a search pattern will find an entry
containing &quot;Staffer&quot; at any level in a hierarchy, like so:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">***      Staffer
</pre></div>

<p>See <a class="xref" href="#HyRolo-Menu">Rolo Menu</a>, for the list of HyRolo search commands.  In this
section, the menu item names from the minibuffer menu are used to
refer to each command.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">RegexFind</code> menu item searches the rolo list for all entries 
which contain matches for a given regular expression.  The regular
expression syntax used is the same as the one used within Emacs
and across the GNU set of tools.  See <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Regexps">Syntax of Regular
Expressions</a> in <cite class="cite">the GNU Emacs Manual</cite>, for full documentation on this
format.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">WordFind</code> menu item locates full-word matches so that if you
search for &lsquo;<samp class="samp">product</samp>&rsquo;, it won&rsquo;t match to occurrences of
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">production</samp>&rsquo;.  It is also handy for more precise name matching.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-logical-rolo-searches"></a>
<p>The <code class="code">StringFind</code> menu item has two uses.  It can find all entry
matches for a string or can execute logical queries for more
precise matching.  The format of logical queries is explained here; a
simple parenthesis delimited prefix format is used with the following
logical operators.
</p>
<div class="example">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">Operator Name   Number of Arguments    Description
=====================================================================
and             two or more            Match entries with all args
or              two or more            Match entries with any args
xor             two or more            Match entries with 1 arg only
not             one                    Match entries without the arg
=====================================================================
</pre></div></div>


<p>For example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(and Company (not Vice-President))
</pre></div>

<p>would match those entries for people associated with &lsquo;<samp class="samp">Company</samp>&rsquo; who
do not have &lsquo;<samp class="samp">Vice-President</samp>&rsquo; titles.
</p>
<p>The following example would provide a list of all people marked as
clients whose area codes are outside of 408 and all non-clients within
the 408 area code.  This could be useful after all clients within
the 408 area code have been contacted and you want to see who else
you should contact.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">(xor 408- client)

<p>After a rolo search is performed, point is left in the <em class="dfn">rolo
match buffer</em>, <samp class="file">*Hyperbole Rolo*</samp>, which uses <code class="code">hyrolo-mode</code> to
simplify browsing many HyRolo matches.  Press <kbd class="kbd">{?}</kbd> when in the
match buffer for a summary of available keys, all of which are
documented in this section.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-rolo_002c-r"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-rolo_002c-search-again"></a>
<p>If your HyRolo search did not match what you want, use <kbd class="kbd">{r}</kbd> to start
a new regular expression query or <kbd class="kbd">{C-u r}</kbd> for a string query.  The
rest of the match buffer keys work with the search results currently
displayed.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-HyRolo_002c-see-rolo"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-rolo_002c-TAB"></a>

<p>If your emacs version supports textual highlighting, each search match
is highlighted for quick, visual location.  {<kbd class="key">TAB</kbd>} moves point
forward to successive spans of text which match the search expression.
<kbd class="kbd">{M-<kbd class="key">TAB</kbd>}</kbd> or <kbd class="kbd">{<kbd class="key">SHIFT</kbd>-<kbd class="key">TAB</kbd>}</kbd> move point backward
to earlier matches.  These keys allow you to quickly find the matching
entry of most interest to you if your search expression failed to
narrow the matches sufficiently.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-rolo_002c-locating-a-name"></a>
<p>If you want to extend the match expression with some more characters
to find a particular entry, use <kbd class="kbd">{M-s}</kbd>.  This performs an
interactive search forward for the match expression.  You may add to
or delete characters from this expression to find different
occurrences or move to the next match with <kbd class="kbd">{C-s}</kbd>.
<kbd class="kbd">{C-r}</kbd> reverses the direction of the search.
</p>
<p>If you would like to search for a specific entry name in the match
buffer, use <kbd class="kbd">{l}</kbd> to interactively locate the text immediately
following the entry start delimiter, typically one or more asterisks.
This lets you find entries by last name quickly, eliminating other
matches.  Standard string, <kbd class="kbd">{C-s}</kbd>, and regular expression,
<kbd class="kbd">{C-M-s}</kbd>, interactive search commands are also available within
the rolo match buffer.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-rolo_002c-outline-of-entries"></a>
<p>Single key outlining commands are also available for browsing matches.
If your search matches a large number of entries, use <kbd class="kbd">{t}</kbd> to get
a top-level summary of entries.  Only the first line of each
first-level match is shown.  If you want to see an overview of all the
levels, use <kbd class="kbd">{o}</kbd> which shows the first line of every entry level.
If you want an overview of just the first two levels, <kbd class="kbd">{C-u 2 o}</kbd>
will work.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-rolo_002c-hiding-entries"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-rolo_002c-showing-entries"></a>
<p>Press <kbd class="kbd">{s}</kbd> to show (expand) the entry at point.  Use <kbd class="kbd">{h}</kbd> to hide
(collapse) the entry.  Press <kbd class="kbd">{a}</kbd> to expand all entries in the
buffer.  If an entry is collapsed/hidden, moving to any hidden part
auto-expands it and then re-collapses it when point is moved to another
entry (just like isearch).  A side-effect of this is that the <kbd class="kbd">{h}</kbd>
hide entry subtree command now moves to the beginning of the entry.

is evaluated after the update of the entry datestamp.  This allows
programmed modification of the way rolo edits work.  The variable,
<code class="code">hyrolo-add-hook</code>, works the same way but is evaluated when a new
entry is first added.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hyrolo_002dfile_002dlist"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-rolo_002c-personal"></a>
<p>The files used in any rolo search are given by the
<code class="code">hyrolo-file-list</code> variable, whose default value is typically
<code class="code">&quot;~/.rolo.otl&quot;</code>.  Searches scan only your personal rolo file.
Any entries added to this list should be absolute filenames.  If a
file in the list does not exist or is not readable, it is skipped.
Files are searched in the order in which they appear in the list.  In
general, you should leave your personal rolo file as the first entry
in the list, since this is the only file to which the Add command on
the rolo menu adds entries.
</p>
<p>Hyperbole releases earlier than 4.17 used a different filename for the
personal rolo.  If such a file exists, you will be prompted to rename
it whenever the HyRolo system is loaded.
</p>
<p>If you want to have HyRolo search your directory of Org files, add the
following to your Emacs initialization file:
</p>
<div class="format">
<pre class="format-preformatted">(add-hook &rsquo;hyperbole-init-hook
	  (lambda ()
	    (require &rsquo;org)
	    (setq hyrolo-file-list (append (hyrolo-initialize-file-list)
					   (cddr (directory-files org-directory))))))
</pre></div>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-BBDB"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Big-Brother-DataBase"></a>
<p>If you use the Big Brother DataBase (BBDB) Emacs package to capture
email addresses and store contact information, the rolo automatically
works with it.  If the BBDB package is loaded before HyRolo, then your
<code class="code">bbdb-file</code> of contacts is added as the second entry in
<code class="code">hyrolo-file-list</code> and will be searched automatically for any matches by
the rolo find commands.  Presently there is no support for editing
BBDB entries, just finding them.
</p>
<p>For finding matches within only BBDB, there are the commands
<code class="code">hyrolo-bbdb-fgrep</code> (string finding) and <code class="code">hyrolo-bbdb-grep</code>
(regular expression finding).  They may be bound to keys if desired.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-contacts_002c-Google"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Google-Contacts"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Gmail-Contacts"></a>
<p>If you use Google/Gmail Contacts, you can configure the HyRolo to
query your Google Contacts for matches.  First you must download and
install the external <samp class="file">google-contacts</samp> package using the Emacs
Package Manager.  Then you must install the non-Emacs GNU Privacy
Guard (GPG) package from <a class="url" href="https://gnupg.org">https://gnupg.org</a> so that
the <samp class="file">gpg</samp> or <samp class="file">gpg2</samp> executable is in your command-line
search path.  Once these are in place, either restart Emacs or
use <kbd class="kbd">{M-x hyrolo-initialize-file-list <kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd> to add Google
Contacts to your searches.
</p>
<p>When you next do a search, you will be prompted for your Google
Contacts password and may also have to enter an authorization code
that will be displayed on your screen.  After authorization, your
your information will be cached so that you are not prompted for
it again within this Emacs session.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hyrolo_002dgoogle_002dcontacts_002dfgrep"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hyrolo_002dgoogle_002dcontacts_002dgrep"></a>
<p>For finding matches within only Google Contacts, there are the commands
<code class="code">hyrolo-google-contacts-fgrep</code> (string finding) and
<code class="code">hyrolo-google-contacts-grep</code> (regular expression finding).  They
may be bound to keys if desired.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hyrolo_002dgoogle_002dcontacts_002dflag"></a>
<p>If you ever need to disable Google Contacts usage, there is a
flag, <code class="code">hyrolo-google-contacts-flag</code>, which when set to &lsquo;<samp class="samp">nil</samp>&rsquo;
disables searching of your Google Contacts.
</p>
<p>Below are the rest of the settings available with HyRolo:

<dd><p>If textual highlighting is available in your emacs on your current

<dd><p>HyRolo file buffers are left around after they are searched, on the
assumption that another search is likely to follow within this emacs
session.  You may wish to change this behavior with the following
setting: <code class="code">(setq hyrolo-kill-buffers-after-use t)</code>.
</p>

<dd><p>After an entry is killed, the modified rolo file is automatically
saved.  If you would rather always save files yourself, use this
setting: <code class="code">(setq hyrolo-save-buffers-after-use nil)</code>.

<dd><p>When an entry is being added from within a mail reader buffer, the
rolo extracts the sender&rsquo;s name and e-mail address and prompts you
with the name as a default.  If you accept the default, it will enter
the name and the email address using the format given by the
<code class="code">hyrolo-email-format</code> variable.  See its documentation if you want to
change its value.
</p>
</dd>
<dt id='index-hyrolo_002dhdr_002dregexp'><span><code class="code">hyrolo-hdr-regexp</code><a class="copiable-link" href='#index-hyrolo_002dhdr_002dregexp'> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>A rolo file may begin with an optional header section which is copied
to the match display buffer whenever any matches are found during a
search.  The start and end lines of this header are controlled by the
regular expression variable, <code class="code">hyrolo-hdr-regexp</code>, whose default value
is &quot;^===&quot;.  This allows lines of all equal signs to visually separate
matching entries retrieved from multiple files during a single search.
</p>
</dd>
<dt id='index-hyrolo_002dentry_002dregexp'><span><code class="code">hyrolo-entry-regexp</code><a class="copiable-link" href='#index-hyrolo_002dentry_002dregexp'> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>The rolo entry start delimiter is given by the regular expression
variable, <code class="code">hyrolo-entry-regexp</code>, whose default value is &quot;^\*+&quot;, i.e. 
one or more asterisks at the beginning of a line.
</p>
</dd>
<dt id='index-hyrolo_002ddisplay_002dformat_002dfunction'><span><code class="code">hyrolo-display-format-function</code><a class="copiable-link" href='#index-hyrolo_002ddisplay_002dformat_002dfunction'> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>When a rolo search is done, each matching entry is passed through the
function given by the variable, <code class="code">hyrolo-display-format-function</code>,
before it is displayed.  This should be a function of one argument,
namely the matching rolo entry as a string.  The string that this
function returns is what is displayed in the rolo match buffer.  The
default function used is <code class="code">identity</code> which passes the string through
unchanged.  If you use the rolo code to search other kinds of
record-oriented data, this variable can be used to format each entry
however you would like to see it displayed.  With a little experience,
you can quickly write functions that use local bindings of the rolo
entry and file settings to search all kinds of record-oriented data.
There is never a need to learn a complicated query language.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-saving-window-configurations"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-file_002c-hywconfig_002eel"></a>
<p>This chapter explains Hyperbole&rsquo;s <samp class="file">hywconfig.el</samp> library.  It lets you
save and restore window configurations, i.e. the layout of windows and
buffers displayed within an emacs frame.  This is useful to save a
particular working context and then to jump back to it at a later time
during an emacs session.  It is also useful during demonstrations to
display many informational artifacts all at once, e.g. all of the windows
for a particular subsystem.  None of this information is stored between
emacs sessions, so your window configurations will last through only a
single session of use.  Each window configuration is tied to the emacs
frame in which it is created.
</p>
<p>The hywconfig library offers two independent ways of managing window
configurations.  The first way associates a name with each stored
window configuration.  The name may then be used to retrieve the window
configuration later.  The second way uses a ring structure to save
window configurations and then allows cycling through the ring of
saved configurations, finally wrapping around to the first entry after
the last entry is encountered.  Simply stop when the desired
configuration is displayed.
</p>
<p>The Win/ menu entry on the Hyperbole top-level menu displays a menu of
hywconfig window configuration commands:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">WinConfig&gt;  AddName  DeleteName  RestoreName  PopRing  SaveRing  YankRing
</pre>
<p>The operations on this menu are defined as follows.

</pre></div></div>

<p>The easiest method to save and restore window configurations shown here is
by name, but it requires that you type the chosen name.  Instead, the ring
commands permit saves and restores using only the mouse.  Since the ring
commands are a bit more complex than their by-name counterparts, the
following paragraphs explain them in more detail.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-kill_002dring"></a>
<p>HyWconfig creates a ring structure that operates just like the Emacs
<code class="code">kill-ring</code> (see <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Kill-Ring">Kill Ring</a> in <cite class="cite">the GNU Emacs Manual</cite>) but its
elements are window configurations rather than text regions.  You can
add an element to the ring to save the current window configuration in
the selected frame.  After several elements are in the ring, you can
walk through all of them in sequence until the desired configuration
is restored.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hywconfig_002dring_002dsave-1"></a>
<p>SaveRing executes the <code class="code">hywconfig-ring-save</code> command which
saves the current window configuration to the ring.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hywconfig_002dyank_002dpop-1"></a>
<p>YankRing executes the <code class="code">hywconfig-yank-pop</code> command.  It restores
the window configuration currently pointed to within the ring.  It
does not delete this configuration from the ring but it does move the
pointer to the prior ring element.  Repeated calls to this command
thus restore successive window configurations until the ring pointer
wraps around.  Simply stop when a desired configuration appears and
use <kbd class="kbd">{q}</kbd> to quit from the minibuffer menu.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hywconfig_002ddelete_002dpop-1"></a>
<p>PopRing calls the <code class="code">hywconfig-delete-pop</code> command.  It is used to
restore a previously saved configuration and to delete it from the ring.
Simply stop when a desired configuration appears and use <kbd class="kbd">{q}</kbd> to
quit from the minibuffer menu.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hywconfig_002dring_002dmax"></a>
<p>The maximum number of elements the ring can hold is set by the
<code class="code">hywconfig-ring-max</code> variable whose default is 10.  Any saves beyond
this value will delete the oldest element in the ring before a new one
is added.

<h3 class="section" id="Hook-Variables-1">10.1 Hook Variables</h3>

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-variables"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hook-variables"></a>
<p>Hyperbole supplies a number of hook variables that allow you to adjust
its basic operations to meet your own needs, without requiring you to
change the code for those operations.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-add_002dhook"></a>
<p>We find it best to always set the value of hook variables either to
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">nil</samp>&rsquo; or to a list of function names of no arguments, each of which
will be called in sequence when the hook is triggered.  If you use
the <code class="code">add-hook</code> function to adjust the value of hooks, it will do
this automatically for you.
</p>
<p>Given the name of a function, a Hyperbole hook variable triggered within
that function has the same name as the function with a &lsquo;<samp class="samp">-hook</samp>&rsquo;
appended.  Hyperbole includes the following hook variables:

<p>New forms of explicit buttons may be created by adding new action types
to a Hyperbole environment.  The file, <samp class="file">hactypes.el</samp>, contains
many examples of working action types.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-action-type_002c-creation"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-defact"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-actype_003acreate-1"></a>
<p>An action type is created, i.e. loaded into the Hyperbole environment,
with the <code class="code">(defact)</code> function (which is an alias for
<code class="code">(actype:create)</code>).  The calling signature for this function is
given in its documentation; it is the same as that of <code class="code">(defun)</code>
except that a documentation string is required.  An interactive
calling form is also required if the action type has formal parameters
and is to be used in explicit or global button definitions.  Implicit
buttons never use an action type&rsquo;s interactive form; however, it is
good practice to include an interactive form since the type creator
cannot know how users may choose to apply the type.
</p>
<p>An action type&rsquo;s parameters are used differently than those of a
function being called.  Its interactive calling form is used to prompt
for type-specific button attributes whenever an explicit button is
created.  The rest of its body is used when a button with this action
type is activated.  Then the button attributes together with the action
type body are used to form an action that is executed in response to the
button activation.  The action&rsquo;s result is returned to the action caller
unless it returns &lsquo;<samp class="samp">nil</samp>&rsquo;, in which case &lsquo;<samp class="samp">t</samp>&rsquo; is returned to the
caller to ensure that it registers the performance of the action.
</p>
<p>An action type body may perform any computation that uses Emacs Lisp and
Hyperbole functions.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-interactive-form"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-interactive"></a>
<p>The interactive calling form for an action type is of the same form as
that of a regular Emacs Lisp function definition (see the
documentation for the Emacs Lisp <code class="code">(interactive)</code> form
or see <a data-manual="elisp" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/elisp.html#Interactive-Codes">Code Characters for &rsquo;interactive&rsquo;</a> in <cite class="cite">the GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite>.  It may additionally use
Hyperbole command character extensions when the form is given as a
string.  Each such extension character <em class="emph">must</em> be preceded by a
plus sign, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">+</samp>&rsquo;, in order to be recognized, since such characters
may also have different standard interactive meanings.

<p>Implicit buttons leverage the same action types used by explicit and
global buttons but each carries an additional implicit button type
that defines the contexts in which it is active, e.g. major modes or
surrounding text.  Once an implicit button type definition is loaded
into Hyperbole, the Action and Assist Keys automatically recognize all
buttons of that type.  The Action Key activates the buttons and the
Assist Key summarizes their behavior and attributes.  With a single
definition, you can bring your text to life, activating implicit
hyperbuttons in thousands of documents with no other effort.
</p>
<p>There are three ways to create new implicit button types; the first
two are meant to allow non-programmers to extend Hyperbole with
simplified types.
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt><b class="b">Action Button Link Types</b></dt>

<h4 class="subsubsection" id="Action-Button-Link-Types-1">10.2.2.1 Action Button Link Types</h4>

<p>The simplest way to create a new implicit link type (from which any
number of buttons can be recognized within text) is to create an
<em class="emph">action button link type</em>.
</p>
<p>A call to the <code class="code">defal</code> macro of the form:
</p>
<p><code class="code">(defal TYPE LINK-EXPR &amp;optional DOC)</code>
</p>
<p>will create a Hyperbole action button link TYPE (an unquoted symbol)
whose buttons always take the form of: <code class="code">&lt;TYPE link-text&gt;</code> where
<code class="code">link-text</code> is substituted into LINK-EXPR as grouping 1 (wherever
%s or \\1 is found) to form the link referent that is displayed for
each button.  Hyperbole automatically creates a doc string for the
type but you can override this by providing an optional DOC string.
</p>
<p>When the Action Key is pressed in a buffer between the start and end
delimiters and the text in-between matches to TEXT-REGEXP, then the
button is activated and does one of four things with LINK-EXPR:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li> executes it as a brace-delimited key series;
</li><li> displays it in a web browser as a URL;
</li><li> displays it as a path (possibly with trailing colon-separated line and column numbers);
</li><li> invokes a function or action type of one argument, the button text sans the function name, to display it.
</li></ol>

<p>For example, if you use Python and have a &lsquo;<samp class="samp">PYTHONLIBPATH</samp>&rsquo; environment
variable, then pressing <kbd class="kbd">{C-x C-e}</kbd> <code class="code">eval-last-sexp</code> after
this expression:
</p>
<p><code class="code">(defal pylib &quot;${PYTHONLIBPATH}/%s&quot;)</code>
</p>
<p>defines a new action button link type called ’pylib’ whose buttons
take the form of:
</p>
<p><code class="code">&lt;pylib PYTHON-LIBRARY-FILENAME&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>and display the associated Python libraries (typically Python source
files).  Optional colon separated line and column numbers may be given
as well.
</p>
<p>Therefore an Action Key press on:
</p>
<p><code class="code">&lt;pylib string.py:5:7&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>would display the source for <samp class="file">string.py</samp> (wherever it is
installed on your system) from the Python standard library with point
on the fifth line at the seventh character.
</p>
<p>See <a class="xref" href="#Implicit-Button-Link-Types">Implicit Button Link Types</a>, for more flexible regular
expression-based link type creation.  See <a class="xref" href="#Programmatic-Implicit-Button-Types">Programmatic Implicit Button Types</a>, for the most general implicit button type creation.

<h4 class="subsubsection" id="Implicit-Button-Link-Types-1">10.2.2.2 Implicit Button Link Types</h4>

<p>If you understand Emacs regular expressions (see <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Regexps">Syntax of
Regular Expressions</a> in <cite class="cite">the GNU Emacs Manual</cite>), you can create new
implicit button types without understanding how to program in Emacs
Lisp, aside from the instructions provided here.
</p>
<p>A call to the <code class="code">defil</code> macro of the form:
</p>
<p><code class="code">(defil TYPE START-DELIM END-DELIM TEXT-REGEXP LINK-EXPR
             &amp;optional START-REGEXP-FLAG END-REGEXP-FLAG DOC)</code>
</p>
<p>will create a new Hyperbole implicit button link TYPE (an unquoted
symbol), recognized in a buffer via START-DELIM and END-DELIM
(strings) and the TEXT-REGEXP pattern between the delimiters.  With
optional START-REGEXP-FLAG true, START-DELIM is treated as a regular
expression.  Similarly, a true value of END-REGEXP-FLAG treats
END-DELIM as a regular expression.  Hyperbole automatically creates a
doc string for the type but you can override this by providing an
optional DOC string.
</p>
<p>When the Action Key is pressed in a buffer between the start and end
delimiters and the text in-between matches to TEXT-REGEXP, then the
button is activated and does one of four things with LINK-EXPR:
</p>
<ol class="enumerate">
<li> executes it as a brace-delimited key series;
</li><li> displays it in a web browser as a URL;
</li><li> displays it as a path (possibly with trailing colon-separated line and column numbers);
</li><li> invokes a function or action type of one argument, the button text (sans the function name if an Action Button), to display it.
</li></ol>

<p>Prior to activation, for the first three kinds of LINK-EXPR, a
<code class="code">replace-match</code> is done on the expression to generate the
button-specific referent to display.  Thus, either the whole button
text (&lsquo;<samp class="samp">\\&amp;</samp>&rsquo;) or any numbered grouping from TEXT-REGEXP,
e.g. &lsquo;<samp class="samp">\\1</samp>&rsquo;, may be referenced in the LINK-EXPR to form the
link referent.
</p>
<p>Here is a sample use case.  Let&rsquo;s create a button type whose
buttons perform a grep-like function over a current repo&rsquo;s git log
entries.  The buttons use this format: [&lt;text to match&gt;].
</p>
<p>The following defines the button type called <code class="code">search-git-log</code> with a 
a key series action surrounded by braces:
</p>
<p><code class="code">(defil search-git-log &quot;[&lt;&quot; &quot;&gt;]&quot; &quot;.*&quot; &quot;{M-: (hypb:fgrep-git-log \&quot;\\&amp;\&quot;) RET}&quot;)</code>
</p>
<p>or this simpler version skips the explicit text substitution (\\\\&amp;)
and instead uses the function that takes the button text as an argument:
</p>
<p><code class="code">(defil search-git-log &quot;[&lt;&quot; &quot;&gt;]&quot; &quot;.*&quot; #’hypb:fgrep-git-log)</code>
</p>
<p>Place point after one of the above expressions and evaluate it with
<kbd class="kbd">{C-x C-e}</kbd> <code class="code">eval-last-sexp</code> to define the implicit button
type.  Then if you have cloned the Hyperbole repo and are in a
Hyperbole source buffer, an Action Key press on a button of the form:
</p>
<p><code class="code">;; [&lt;test release&gt;]</code>
</p>
<p>will display one line per commit whose change set matches &rsquo;test
release&rsquo;.  An Action Key press on any such line will then display the
commit changes.
</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t mind extra text for every button, you could instead use
Action Buttons of the form: &lt;hypb:fgrep-git-log &quot;string&quot;&gt; to do the
same thing without any special definitions.

<p>An implicit button type is created or loaded via the <code class="code">(defib)</code>
function (which is an alias for <code class="code">(ibtype:create)</code>).  The calling
signature for this function is given in its documentation; it is the
same as that of <code class="code">(defun)</code>, but with a number of constraints.  The
parameter list should always be empty since no parameters will be used.
A documentation string is required; it is followed by the body of the
type.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-ibtype_002c-actype"></a>
<p>The body of an implicit button type is a predicate which determines
whether or not point is within an implicit button of the type.  If not,
the predicate returns &lsquo;<samp class="samp">nil</samp>&rsquo;.  If so, it may optionally setup to
flash the button and then to perform one or more actions.  A call of the
form: <code class="code">(ibut:label-set label start-pos end-pos)</code> is used to setup
the button flashing, if desired.  This is then typically immediately
followed by an action invocation of the form:
<code class="code">(hact 'actype &amp;rest actype-arguments)</code> where <code class="code">actype</code> is a
Hyperbole action type symbol or an Emacs Lisp function name or lambda;
<code class="code">actype-arguments</code> are the arguments fed to the action invocation
when an implicit button of the type is activated.
</p>
<p>It is imperative that all actions (non-predicate code) be invoked
through the <code class="code">(hact)</code> function or your ibtypes will not work
properly.  (Hyperbole first tests to see if any ibtype matches the
current context before activating any type, so it ensures that
<code class="code">(hact)</code> calls are disabled during this testing.)  Any action
types used in the definition of an implicit button type may be created
before or after the definition, but obviously, must be defined before
any implicit buttons of the given type are activated; an error will
result, otherwise.
</p>
<p>If an implicit button type create is successful, the symbol that
Hyperbole uses internally to reference the type is returned.  On
failure, &lsquo;<samp class="samp">nil</samp>&rsquo; is returned so that you may test whether or not the
operation succeeds.  Implicit button type names and action type names
may be the same without any conflict.  In fact, such naming is
encouraged when an implicit button type is the exclusive user of an
action type.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-ibtype_003adelete"></a>
<p>Call <code class="code">(ibtype:delete)</code> to remove an implicit button type from a
Hyperbole environment.  It takes a single parameter which should be the
same type symbol used in the type definition call (not the Hyperbole
symbol returned by the call).  This will not delete the action type used
by the implicit button; that must be done separately.

<p>By default, a request for help on an implicit button will display the
button&rsquo;s attributes in the same manner as is done for explicit buttons.
For some implicit button types, other forms of help will be more
appropriate.  If an Emacs Lisp function is defined whose name is formed
from the concatenation of the type name followed by &lsquo;<samp class="samp">:help</samp>&rsquo;, e.g.
<code class="code">my-ibtype:help</code>, it is used as the assist-action whenever the
Assist Key is pressed, to respond to requests for help on buttons of
that type.  Any such function should take a single argument of an
implicit button construct.  (This is what
<code class="code">(ibut:at-p)</code> returns when point is within an implicit button
context.)  The button may be queried for its attributes using
functions from the &lsquo;<samp class="samp">hbut</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp class="samp">hattr</samp>&rsquo; classes.  See
the <samp class="file">hib-kbd.el</samp> file for an example of a custom help function.

<p>Hyperbole uses a normalized form of button labels called button keys (or
label keys) for all internal operations.  See the documentation for the
function <code class="code">(hbut:label-to-key)</code> for details of the normalization
process.  The normalized form permits Hyperbole to recognize buttons that
are the same but whose labels appear different from one another, due to
text formatting conventions.  For example, all of the following would
be recognized as the same button.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted">  &lt;(fake button)&gt;     &lt;( fake      button)&gt;

  Pam&gt;  &lt;(fake
  Pam&gt;    button)&gt;

  ;; &lt;(fake
  ;;   button)&gt;

  /* &lt;( fake      */
  /*    button )&gt; */

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-button_002c-multiple-lines"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-button_002c-split-across-lines"></a>
<p>The last three examples demonstrate how Hyperbole ignores common fill
prefix patterns that happen to fall within the middle of a button label
that spans multiple lines.  As long as such buttons are selected with
point at a location within the label&rsquo;s first line, the button will be
recognized.  The variable <code class="code">hbut:fill-prefix-regexps</code> holds the list
of fill prefixes recognized when embedded within button labels.  All
such prefixes are recognized (one per button label), regardless of the
setting of the Emacs variable, <code class="code">fill-prefix</code>, so no user
intervention is required.

<p>Hyperbole uses a terse format to store explicit buttons and a more
meaningful one to show users and to manipulate during editing.  The
terse format consists solely of button attribute values whereas the edit
format includes an attribute name with each attribute value.  A button
in edit format consists of a Lisp symbol together with its attribute list
which holds the attribute names and values.  In this way, buttons may be
passed along from function to function simply by passing the symbol to
which the button is attached.  Most functions utilize the pre-defined
<code class="code">hbut:current</code> symbol by default to store and retrieve the last
encountered button in edit format.

name/value format.  This separation permits the wholesale replacement of
the storage manager with another, with any interface changes hidden from
any Hyperbole client programming.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-explicit-button_002c-programmatic-creation"></a>
<p>A common need when developing with Hyperbole is to create or to modify
explicit buttons without user interaction.  For example, an application
might require the addition of an explicit summary button to a file for
each new mail message a user reads that contains a set of keywords.  The
user could then check the summary file and jump to desired messages
quickly.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-class_002c-ebut-1"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-file_002c-hbut_002eel-1"></a>
<p>The Hyperbole class &lsquo;<samp class="samp">ebut</samp>&rsquo; supports programmatic access to explicit
buttons.  Examine it within the <samp class="file">hbut.el</samp> file for full details.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-ebut_003aprogram"></a>
<p>The simplest way to create explicit buttons programmatically is to
call <code class="code">ebut:program</code>.  This generates an explicit button at point
from LABEL, ACTYPE (action type) and any optional ACTYPE ARGS.
It inserts the LABEL text at point surrounded by &lt;( )&gt; delimiters, adding any
necessary instance number of the button after the LABEL.  ACTYPE may
be a Hyperbole action type name (from defact) or an Emacs Lisp
function, followed by a list of arguments for the actype, aside from
the button LABEL which is automatically provided as the first argument.
</p>
<p>For interactive explicit creation, use <code class="code">hui:ebut-create</code> instead.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-ebut_003acreate"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-ebut_003amap"></a>
<p>The documentation for <code class="code">(ebut:create)</code> explains the set of
attributes necessary to create an explicit button.  For operations over
the whole set of buttons within the visible (non-narrowed) portion of a
buffer, use the <code class="code">(ebut:map)</code> function.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-gbut_003aebut_002dprogram"></a>
<p>Similarly, <code class="code">gbut:ebut-program</code> programmatically adds global explicit
buttons at the end of the personal button file.

<p>The standard Hyperbole user interface has purposely been separated from
the Hyperbole backend to support the development of alternative
interfaces and the embedding of Hyperbole functionality within other
system prototypes.  The Hyperbole backend functionality that system
developers can make use of is called its Application Programming
Interface (API).  The API may be used to make server-based calls to
Hyperbole when Emacs is run as a non-interactive (batch) process, with
its input/output streams attached to another process.
</p>
<p>The public functions and variables from the following files may be
considered the present Hyperbole API:
</p>
<p><samp class="file">hact.el</samp>, <samp class="file">hargs.el</samp>, <samp class="file">hbmap.el</samp>, <samp class="file">hbut.el</samp>,
<samp class="file">hhist.el</samp>, <samp class="file">hmail.el</samp>, <samp class="file">hmoccur.el</samp>, <samp class="file">hpath.el</samp>,

<samp class="file">hywconfig.el</samp> and <samp class="file">set.el</samp>.
</p>

<p>Note when looking at these files, that they are divided into sections
that separate one data abstraction (class) from another.  A line of
dashes within a class separates public parts of the class from the
private parts that follow the line.
</p>
<p>This API does not include the Hyperbole Koutliner, as it has been
designed for interactive use, rather than programmatic extensibility.
You are welcome, however, to study its code, below the
<samp class="file">hyperbole-${hyperb:version}/kotl/</samp> directory.

</p>
</dd>
<dt><b class="b">Hypertext</b></dt>
<dd><p>A text or group of texts which may be explored in a non-linear fashion
through associative linkages embedded throughout the text.  Instead of
simply referring to other pieces of work, hypertext references when
followed actually take you to the works themselves.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><b class="b">HyRolo</b></dt>
<dd><p>HyRolo, the Hyperbole record/contact manager, provides rapid lookup of
multi-line, hierarchically ordered free form text records.  It can
also lookup records from Google/GMail Contacts and the Big Brother
DataBase (BBDB) package.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><b class="b">Ilink</b></dt>
<dt><b class="b">link-to-ibut</b></dt>
<dd><p>An Action Button that links to another implicit button.  It begins with &lt;ilink:
followed by an implicit button label, an optional ibut file and ends with a
closing &gt;.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><b class="b">Implicit Button</b></dt>
<dd><p>A button recognized contextually by Hyperbole.  Such buttons contain no
button data but may have an optional preceding label that looks like this:
&lsquo;<samp class="samp">&lt;[label]&gt;</samp>&rsquo;.  See also <b class="b">implicit button type</b>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><b class="b">Implicit Button Type</b></dt>
<dd><p>A specification of how to recognize and activate implicit buttons of a
specific kind.  Implicit button types often utilize structure internal
to documents created and managed by tools other than Hyperbole, for
example, programming documentation.  <b class="b">Ibtype</b> is a synonym for
implicit button type.  See also <b class="b">system encapsulation</b>.
</p>
<p>Internally, Hyperbole defines its own namespace for ibtypes defined
with its <code class="code">defib</code> macro by prefixing them with <code class="code">ibtypes::</code>.
Symbols with this prefix are invokable Emacs Lisp functions.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-InfoDock"></a>
</dd>
<dt><b class="b">InfoDock</b></dt>
<dd><p>InfoDock is an older integrated productivity toolset for software engineers
and knowledge workers built atop XEmacs; it is no longer maintained or
updated, though many of its packages can be used with GNU Emacs.  An older
version from 1999 may be found at infodock.sf.net.
</p>
<p>InfoDock has much of the power of GNU Emacs, but with an easier to use and
more comprehensive menu-based user interface.  Most objections people raise
to using emacs have already been addressed in InfoDock.  InfoDock is meant
for people who prefer a complete, pre-customized environment in one package.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><b class="b">Instance Number</b></dt>
<dd><p>A colon prefaced number appended to the label of a newly created button
when the button&rsquo;s label duplicates the label of an existing button in
the current buffer.  This number makes the label unique and so allows
any number of buttons with the same base label within a single buffer.

  1.2       - relative id, legal style
  012       - permanent idstamp
  1a=012    - both relative and permanent ids (in that order) separated by =
  |viewspec - a viewspec setting, rather than a cell reference
</p>
<p>Optionally, any of these id forms (or the relative form) may be followed by
zero or more whitespace characters, a | and some view specification
characters.  See <a class="xref" href="#View-Specs">View Specs</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><b class="b">Klink</b></dt>

</p>
<p>The GNU OO-Browser is a multi-windowed, interactive object-oriented class
browser similar in use to the well-known Smalltalk browsers.  It runs
inside Emacs.  It is unique in a number of respects foremost of which is
that it works well with most major object-oriented languages in use today.
You can switch from browsing in one language to another in a few seconds.
It provides both textual views within an editor and graphical views under
the X window system and Windows.  It includes support for C, C++, Common
Lisp and its Object System (CLOS), Eiffel, Java, Objective-C, Python and
Smalltalk.
</p>
<p>Hyperbole provides the mouse support for the OO-Browser, providing Smart
Keys that utilize the OO-Browser&rsquo;s capabilities both when it is displayed
on screen and when editing code.

<p>If you are old-school, don&rsquo;t like package managers, and prefer doing
everything by hand, then you can obtain Hyperbole from a tarball:
</p>
<p>Download either:
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt>1. a stable release tar.gz source archive from either:</dt>
<dd><p><a class="url" href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hyperbole/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hyperbole/</a> or
<a class="url" href="http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/hyperbole/">http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/hyperbole/</a>, which will find the closest
mirror of the GNU ftp site and show it to you.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>2. the latest in-development pre-release tar.gz source archive linked to at the top of this web page:</dt>
<dd><p><a class="url" href="https://elpa.gnu.org/devel/hyperbole.html">https://elpa.gnu.org/devel/hyperbole.html</a>.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Then decompress and unpack the archive to a directory of your
choosing.  Move into the <samp class="file">hyperbole-&lt;version&gt;/</samp> directory and execute
the following Posix shell command:
</p>
<p><code class="code">make bin</code>
</p>
<p>to byte-compile the Hyperbole lisp files.  Then add the following
lines to your personal Emacs initialization file, <samp class="file">~/.emacs</samp>:
</p>
<div class="example lisp">
<div class="group"><pre class="lisp-preformatted">(unless (and (featurep 'hyperbole) hyperbole-mode)

permits setting a specific Emacs function or external program to display
them.  There are four categories of referents, each with its own
customizable display setting, listed in decreasing order of priority.

<p>When given a filename to display, Hyperbole first checks if its suffix
is matched by <code class="code">hpath:native-image-suffixes</code>.  If so and if the
function <code class="code">image-mode</code> is defined, it uses that mode together with
the value of <code class="code">hpath:display-where</code> to display the image within an
Emacs buffer.
</p>
<p>If no match is found, the <code class="code">hpath:internal-display-alist</code> variable
is checked for a filename match.  Its value is an association list
whose elements are (&lt;file-name-regular-expression&gt;
. &lt;function-of-one-arg&gt;) pairs.  Any path whose name matches
a &lt;file-name-regular-expression&gt; will be displayed by calling the
associated &lt;function-of-one-arg&gt; with the filename as the argument.
The first regular expression that matches each filename is the one
used.  This can be used to format raw data files for convenient
display.
</p>
<p>By default, this setting handles the following types of files:
</p><dl class="table">
<dt><em class="emph">&bull; Audio Files</em></dt>
<dd><p>Major audio format files are played with the <code class="code">play-sound-file</code> command.

<dd><p>Files with a <samp class="file">.info</samp> suffix (may also be compressed) are displayed in the Info browser.

<p>If you use Hyperbole under a window system,
the <code class="code">hpath:get-external-display-alist</code> function in <samp class="file">hpath.el</samp>
supports hyperlinks that open files using external, non-Emacs tools, e.g.
a pdf reader or a vector graphics viewer.
</p>
<p>The value returned by <code class="code">hpath:get-external-display-alist</code> is determined
based on the window system supported by the current frame and the version
of Emacs in use.  This value is an association list whose elements are
(&lt;file-name-regular-expression&gt; . &lt;viewer-program-or-list&gt;) pairs.  Any
path whose name matches a &lt;file-name-regular-expression&gt; will be
displayed using the corresponding viewer-program or the first
viewer-program found on the system from a list of programs.  If a
&lt;viewer-program&gt; entry contains a &lsquo;<samp class="samp">%s</samp>&rsquo; string, the filename to
display is substituted at that point within the string.
Otherwise, the filename is appended to the &lt;viewer-program&gt;
entry.  Alternatively, the viewer-program may be a Lisp function that
takes a single filename argument.
</p>
<p>The association lists used by this function are stored in variables
for each available window system: <code class="code">hpath:external-display-alist-macos</code>,
<code class="code">hpath:external-display-alist-mswindows</code>, and
<code class="code">hpath:external-display-alist-x</code>.  Examine and modify these
values to suit your needs.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hpath_003aexternal_002dfile_002dsuffixes"></a>
<p>Part of these values for each operating system come from the
variable, <code class="code">hpath:external-file-suffixes</code>&rsquo;, which holds a regular
expression of operating system independent file suffixes to open outside
Emacs.

<p>Another option to consider modifying is <code class="code">hpath:variables</code>.  This
option consists of a list of Emacs Lisp variable names, each of which
may have a pathname or a list of pathnames as a value.  Whenever a
Hyperbole file or directory link button is created, its pathname is
compared against the values in <code class="code">hpath:variables</code>.  The first
match found, if any, is selected and its associated variable name is
substituted into the link pathname, in place of its literal value.
When a link button is activated, potentially at a different site,
Hyperbole replaces each variable in the link pathname with the first
matching value from this list to recreate the literal pathname.
Environment variables and Emacs Lisp variables delimited
by \&quot;${variable-name}\&quot; are also replaced whenever link paths are
resolved.
</p>
<p>This permits sharing of links over wide areas, where the variable values
differ between link creator and link activator.  The entire process
is wholly transparent to the user; it is explained here simply to help
you in deciding whether or not to modify the value of <code class="code">hpath:variables</code>.

always available.  Your standard web browser will be used to return
the search results.

<p>The <code class="code">hyperbole-web-search-alist</code> variable controls the items in

(&lt;web-service-name&gt; . &lt;url-with-%s-parameter-or-command&gt;).  The first
capitalized character of each &lt;web-service-name&gt; must be unique for
minibuffer menu selection.  The second part of an element is either:
</p><dl class="table">

<dd><p>a URL with an embedded %s indicating where to substitute a search term
that is interactively prompted for when the menu item is activated;
</p></dd>

menu with <kbd class="kbd">{M-x customize-variable <kbd class="key">RET</kbd>
hyperbole-web-search-alist <kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd>.  Changes are automatically
reflected in the Hyperbole menus once applied.  Remember each search
engine name must begin with a unique letter and each URL must have a

<p>Hyperbole always recognizes URLs within buffers when the Action Key is

and have it displayed.  Hyperbole can recognize s/ftp and www URLs given to
the <code class="code">find-file</code> command (or any other <code class="code">find-file-*</code> commands).
But because there is added overhead with this feature, it is not enabled by
default.

<p>This is largely for outline modes such as the Koutliner.  By default,
character-by-character interactive search on <kbd class="kbd">{C-s}</kbd> will search
through invisible/hidden text, making the text temporarily visible
until point moves past that hidden part.  When a search match is
selected, the surrounding text remains visible.
</p>
<p>You can temporarily disable searching of hidden text by typing <kbd class="kbd">{M-s i}</kbd>
while in an incremental search.  This key sequence toggles that
setting and makes searches look at only visible text (or the reverse
when invoked again).  The setting lasts only through the current
interactive search.

<p>When Hyperbole is run under a window system, it automatically
highlights any explicit buttons in a buffer and makes them flash when
selected.  The main setting you may want change is the selection of a
color (or style) for button highlighting and button flashing.  See
the <samp class="file">hui-*-b*.el</samp> files for lists of potential colors and the
code which supports this behavior.  A call
to <code class="code">(hproperty:cycle-but-color)</code> in the <samp class="file">hsettings.el</samp> file
changes the color used to highlight and flash explicit buttons.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hproperty_003abut_002dflash_002dtime_002dseconds"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-button-flash-time"></a>
<p>You may also change the length of time in fractions of a second that a
button flashes by setting <code class="code">hproperty:but-flash-time-seconds</code>.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hproperty_003abut_002dhighlight_002dflag"></a>
<p>Whether or not buttons are highlighted is controlled
by <code class="code">hproperty:but-highlight-flag</code>, which defaults to &lsquo;<samp class="samp">t</samp>&rsquo;.
To disable highlighting, change this setting in <samp class="file">hsettings.el</samp> or
use Hyperbole menu item, Cust/All-Options, and select the Hyperbole
Buttons group to edit its options.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hproperty_003abut_002dcreate"></a>
<p>If you read in a file with explicit buttons before you load Hyperbole,
these buttons won&rsquo;t be highlighted.  Load Hyperbole and then use
<kbd class="kbd">{M-x hproperty:but-create <kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd> to highlight the buttons in
the current buffer.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-button-emphasis"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hproperty_003abut_002demphasize_002dflag"></a>
<p>Additionally, if <code class="code">hproperty:but-emphasize-flag</code> is set to &lsquo;<samp class="samp">t</samp>&rsquo;,
then whenever the mouse pointer moves over an explicit button, it will
be emphasized in a different color or style.  This emphasis is in
addition to any non-mouse-sensitive button highlighting.

<p>Hyperbole includes over 200 automated test cases in the <samp class="file">test/</samp>
subdirectory.  You can run all of them by moving to the Hyperbole home
directory in a Posix shell and run <code class="code">make test-all</code> or <code class="code">make

press the Action Key to see the source of the failure.  Full testing is
supported under POSIX systems only.

<p>With Hyperbole active, you can also define implicit buttons that run
individual or sets of Hyperbole tests.  The file <samp class="file">hypb-ert.el</samp> contains
two action link types:

<div class="example">
<pre class="example-preformatted"><code class="code">hyperbole-run-test</code>  - run a single Hyperbole test by name
<code class="code">hyperbole-run-tests</code> - run one more tests matching a pattern

Example uses with a press of the Action Key:

  Run the test hbut-defal-url:
    &lt;hyperbole-run-test hbut-defal-url&gt;

  Run the tests specified by the test selector hbut-defal:

<h2 class="appendix" id="Smart-Key-Reference-1">Appendix E Smart Key Reference</h2>

<p>This appendix documents Hyperbole&rsquo;s context-sensitive Smart Key
operations.  It is quite extensive and is meant for reference rather
than sequential reading.  See <a class="xref" href="#Smart-Keys">Smart Keys</a>, for a description of the
Smart Keys.  That section also describes how to get context-sensitive
Smart Key help, with which you can explore Smart Key operation bit by
bit.
</p>
<p>What a Smart Key does depends on the context in which it is used.
Smart Key operations are context-sensitive.  Contexts are defined by
logic conditionals, e.g. when depressed here, if this is true, etc.
Each Smart Key context is listed in the order in which it will be
checked.  The first matching context is always the one applied.
Within each context, the actions performed by the Action and Assist
Keys are given.

Smart Key operations in <a class="ref" href="#Smart-Keyboard-Keys">Smart Keyboard Keys</a>, apply to both mouse
and keyboard Smart Key usage.
</p>
<p>The following section documents what the Smart Mouse Keys do in each

i.e. the first context to match is the one that is used.  If no
matching mouse key context is found, then the keyboard key contexts
are searched in order.

</p>
<p>If no region is selected when the Action Mouse Key is dragged from a
thing delimiter to another location, it copies the delimited thing to
the release point of the drag.  The release location may be in the
same or a different buffer but if in the same buffer it must be
outside of the delimited thing itself.  Similarly, the Assist Mouse
Key kills (cuts) the delimited thing at its original location and
yanks (pastes) it at the new location.
</p>
<p>The start of the drag must be on the first character of the starting
or ending delimiter.  For strings and comments, the drag must start on
the first line of the thing.
</p>
<p>Experiment with these drag actions and you will quickly find them easy
to use and indispensable.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-version-description"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Hyperbole-version"></a>
<p>If you find any errors in Hyperbole&rsquo;s operation or documentation, feel
free to report them to &lt;bug-hyperbole@gnu.org&gt;.  Be sure to use the
<kbd class="kbd">{C-h h m r}</kbd> Msg/Report-Hypb-Bug minibuffer menu item whenever you send a message
to this address since that command will insert important system
version information for you.
</p>
<p>If you use Hyperbole mail or news support (see <a class="pxref" href="#Buttons-in-Mail">Buttons in Mail</a>), a
press of your Action Key on the Hyperbole mail list address will
insert a description of your Hyperbole configuration information into
your outgoing message, so that you do not have to type it.  Otherwise,
be sure to include the version numbers of your editor, Hyperbole and
your window system.  Your Hyperbole version number can be found in the
top-level Hyperbole menu.
</p>
<p>Below are some tips on how best to structure requests and discussion
messages.  If you share information about your use of Hyperbole with
others, it will promote broader use and development of Hyperbole.
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>Always use your Subject lines to state the position that your message
takes on the topic that it addresses.

<div class="display">
<pre class="display-preformatted">For example, write: &ldquo;Subject: Typo in top-level Hyperbole minibuffer menu.&rdquo;

rather than: &ldquo;Subject: Hyperbole bug&rdquo;
</pre></div>

</li><li>Statements end with periods, questions with question marks (typically),
and high energy, high impact declarations with exclamation points.  These
simple rules make all e-mail communication much easier for recipients to
handle appropriately.

</li><li><a class="index-entry-id" id="index-emacs_002dversion"></a>
Question messages should normally include your Hyperbole and Emacs
version numbers and should clearly explain your problem and surrounding
issues.  Otherwise, it is difficult for anyone to answer your question.
(Your top-level Hyperbole menu shows its version number and <kbd class="kbd">{M-x
emacs-version <kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd> gives the other.)

</li><li>If you ask questions, you should consider adding to the discussion by
telling people the kinds of work you are doing or contemplating doing
with Hyperbole.  In this way, the list is not overrun by messages that
ask for, but provide no information.
</li></ul>

<p>If you have suggestions on how to improve Hyperbole, send them to
&lt;hyperbole-users@gnu.com&gt; (<kbd class="kbd">{C-h h m c}</kbd> minibuffer menu item
Msg/Compose-Hypb-Mail).  Here are some issues you might address:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>What did you like and dislike about the system?
</li><li>What kinds of tasks, if any, does it seem to help you with?
</li><li>What did you think of the Emacs-based user interface?
</li><li>How was the Hyperbole Manual and other documentation?
</li><li>Was the setup trivial, average or hard?
</li><li>What areas of Hyperbole would you like to see expanded/added?
</li><li>How does it compare to other hypertext tools you have used?
</li><li>Was it easy or difficult to create your own types?  Why?
</li><li>Did you get any use out of the external system encapsulations?
</li></ul>

<ol class="enumerate">
<li> As I discover the Zen of Hyperbole, will I become so enamored of its power that I lose all control of my physical faculties?

<p>This other-worldly reaction is of course an individual matter.  Some
people have canceled meditation trips to the Far East after
discovering that pressing the Action Key in random contexts serves a
similar purpose much more cheaply.  We have not seen anyone&rsquo;s mind
turn to jelly but with the cognition Hyperbole saves you, you might
just grow a second one.  Eventually, you will be at peace and will
understand that there is no adequate description of Hyperbole.  Just
let it flow through you.
</p>
<p>Ok, joking aside, now that we have your attention, here are some
serious questions and answers.
</p>
</li><li> <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-Org_002dmode"></a>
Isn&rsquo;t Org-mode the same as Hyperbole?

<p>No, they offer very different capabilities when you compare them a bit
more deeply.  In fact, it makes sense to use them together and they
are highly compatible.  The only overlap we see is that Org-mode has a
more limited kind of hyperlinks and offers some BBDB integration as
Hyperbole does.  For a list of some differences, see:
<a class="url" href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Hyperbole">https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Hyperbole</a>.
</p>
<p>Org-mode offers traditional Emacs outlining, todo list management,
agenda and diary management, so it is very complementary to Hyperbole.
It did not exist when Hyperbole was first developed.
</p>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hsys_002dorg_002denable_002dsmart_002dkeys-2"></a>
<p>Smart Key support for Org-mode is already in Hyperbole.  Use the
<code class="code">hsys-org-enable-smart-keys</code> customization variable to control
the Smart Keys and <kbd class="kbd">{M-<kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd> when in Org-mode with
<code class="code">hyperbole-mode</code> active.  <code class="code">t</code> enables Smart Key support
everywhere.  The symbol, <code class="code">buttons</code>, is the default; it means the
Smart Keys are active only when point is within a Hyperbole button.  A
<code class="code">nil</code> value means no Smart Key support; Hyperbole gives Org
complete control over <kbd class="kbd">{M-<kbd class="key">RET</kbd>}</kbd> so that it behaves just as it
does normally in Org mode.

How can I change the Smart Mouse Key bindings?

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hmouse_002dsetup-1"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hmouse_002dget_002dbindings-1"></a>
<p>Since the Smart Mouse Keys are set up for use under many different
Emacs configurations, there is no easy way to provide user level
customization.  Any mouse key binding changes require editing the
<code class="code">(hmouse-setup)</code> and <code class="code">(hmouse-get-bindings)</code> functions in the
<samp class="file">hmouse-sh.el</samp> file.

<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hkey_002dalist"></a>
<a class="index-entry-id" id="index-hmouse_002dalist"></a>
<p>To make the Smart Keys do new things in particular contexts, define new
types of implicit buttons, see <a class="pxref" href="#Implicit-Buttons">Implicit Buttons</a>.
</p>
<p>The <code class="code">hkey-alist</code> and <code class="code">hmouse-alist</code> variables in
<samp class="file">hui-mouse.el</samp> and <samp class="file">hui-window.el</samp> must be altered if you want
to change what the Smart Keys do in standard contexts.  You should
then update the Smart Key summary documentation in the file,
<samp class="file">man/hkey-help.txt</samp>, and then regenerate the readable forms of
this manual which includes that file.
</p>
</li><li> What if I get mail with a Hyperbole button type I don&rsquo;t have?

<p>Or what if someone sends a mail message with a button whose link
referent I can&rsquo;t access?
</p>
<p>You receive an error that an action type is not defined or a link
referent is not accessible/readable if you try to use the button.  This
is hardly different than trying to get through a locked door without a
key; you try the doorknob, find that it is locked, and then realize that
you need to take a different approach or else give up.
</p>
<p>Like all communication, people need to coordinate, which usually
requires an iterative process.  If you get a mail message with a button
for which you don&rsquo;t have the action type, you mail the sender and
request it.
</p>
</li><li> <a class="index-entry-id" id="index-global-button_002c-modify"></a>
How can I modify a number of global buttons in succession?

<p>Rather than typing the name for each, it is quicker to jump to the
global button file and edit the buttons there as you would any
explicit or implicit buttons.  By default, the ButFile/PersonalFile
menu item takes you to the file where global buttons are saved.
Global buttons are saved near the end of this file.
</p>
</li><li> Why are button attributes scattered across directories?

<p>When you think of a hyperspace that you depend on every day, you
don&rsquo;t want to have a single point of failure that can make you
incapable of doing work.  With Hyperbole, if some directories become
unavailable for a particular time (e.g. the filesystems on which
they reside are dismounted) you can still work elsewhere with minimal
effect.  We believe this to be a compelling factor to leave the design
with distributed button attribute storage.
</p>
<p>This design also permits the potential addition of buttons to read-only
media.
</p>
</li><li> Why are action types defined apart from implicit button types?

<p>Any category of button can make use of any action type.  Some action
types are useful as behavior definitions for a variety of button
categories, so all action types are defined separately to give them
independence from those types which apply them.
</p>
<p>For implicit button types that require a lot of code, it is useful to
add a module that includes the implicit button type definition, its
action type definition and supporting code.  Then simply load that
module into your Emacs session.

</div>
<h2 class="appendix" id="Future-Work-1">Appendix H Future Work</h2>

<p>This appendix is included for a number of reasons:
</p>
<ul class="itemize mark-bullet">
<li>to better allow you to assess whether to work with Hyperbole by
providing sketches of possible additions;
</li><li>to direct further development effort towards known needs;
</li><li>and to acknowledge known weaknesses in the current system.
</li></ul>

<p>Without any serious interest from users, progress on these fronts will
be slow.  Here are some new features we have in mind, however.
</p>
<dl class="table">
<dt>Button Copying, Killing, and Yanking</dt>
<dd><p>There is as yet no means of transferring explicit buttons among
buffers. We realize this is an important need.  Users should be able to
manipulate text with embedded buttons in ordinary ways.  With this
feature, Hyperbole would store the button attributes as text
properties within the buffers so that if a button is copied, its
attributes follow.  When a buffer is saved, the attributes also will
be saved.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Koutliner View Mode</dt>
<dd><p>This will complement the Koutliner editing mode by using simple one
character keys that normally insert characters to instead modify the
view of a Koutline and to move around in it, for ease of study.
Switching between view and edit modes will also be simple.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Direct Manipulation</dt>
<dd><p>Hyperbole is designed to let you rapidly navigate and manipulate
large, distributed information spaces.  Being able to directly
manipulate entities in these spaces will accelerate understanding and
production of new information.  Already Hyperbole lets you drag
buffers, windows, files, and directories and place them where you
like.  But there is much more that can be done to allow for
higher-level browsing and information organization.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Trails</dt>
<dd><p>Trails are an extension to the basic history mechanism presently offered
by Hyperbole.  Trails will allow a user to capture, edit and store a
specific sequence and set of views of information for later replay by
other users.  Conditional branching may also be supported.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Storage of button data within button source files</dt>
<dd><p>The current design choice of storing buttons external to the source file
was made under the assumption that people should be able to look at
files that contain Hyperbole buttons with any standard editor or tool
and not be bothered by the ugly button data (since they won&rsquo;t be able to
utilize the buttons anyway, they don&rsquo;t need to see or have access to
them).
</p>
<p>In many contexts, embedding the button data within the source files may
be a better choice, so a provision which would allow selection of either
configuration may be added.  Here are some of the PROs and CONs of both
design choices:
</p><br>
</dd>
</dl>

<div class="example">
<div class="group"><pre class="example-preformatted">           POSITIVE                        NEGATIVE

           No special display formatting   locked when any button
           is necessary.                   entry is locked.

           Button-based searches and
           database-type lookup operations
           need only search one file
           per directory.
</pre></div></div>
<br>
<br>

<dl class="table">
<dt>Forms-based Interfaces</dt>
<dd>
<p>This will allow one to create buttons more flexibly.  For example, button
attributes could be given in any order.  Entry of long code sequences,
quick note taking and cross-referencing would also be made easier.
</p>
</dd>
<dt>Collaboration Support</dt>
<dd>
<p>From the early stages of Hyperbole design, collaborative work
environments have been considered.  A simple facility has demonstrated
broadcast of button activations to a number of workstations on a local
area network, so that one user can lead others around an information
space, as during an online design review.  (This facility was never
adapted to the current Hyperbole release, however).  Nowadays you
could just use a screen sharing program.

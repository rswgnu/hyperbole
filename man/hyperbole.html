<p>This manual explains user operation and summarizes basic developer
facilities of GNU Hyperbole.  Hyperbole provides convenient access
to information, control over its display and easy linking of items
across documents and across the web.  The Hyperbole Koutliner offers
flexible views and structure manipulation within bodies of
information.
</p>
<p>We hope you enjoy using Hyperbole and that it improves your
productivity.  If it does, consider sending us a quote or short note
discussing how it helps you.  We may use your submission to help
promote further use of Hyperbole; all submissions will be considered
freely reusable and will fall under the same license as Hyperbole.
E-mail your quote to &lt;hyperbole-users@gnu.org&gt;.  We volunteer our
time on Hyperbole and love to hear user stories in addition to any
problem reports.
</p>
<p>Before we delve into Hyperbole, a number of acknowledgments are in
order.  Many thanks to Mats Lidell, a long-time Hyperbole user and
developer, who maintains Hyperbole with me and with whom I enjoy
interacting.  Peter Wegner and Morris Moore encouraged the growth of
this work.  Douglas Engelbart showed us the bigger picture and will
forever be an inspiration.  His life-long quest at augmenting
individual and team capabilities represents a model from which we

<p>This edition of the GNU Hyperbole Manual is for use with any version
9.0.2pre or greater of GNU Hyperbole.  Hyperbole runs atop GNU Emacs 27.2
or higher.  It will trigger an error if your Emacs is older.
</p>
<p>This chapter summarizes the structure of the rest of the manual,
describes Hyperbole, lists some of its potential applications, and

<p>Throughout this manual, sequences of keystrokes are delimited by curly
braces <kbd>{ }</kbd>; function and variable names use this <code>typeface</code>.
</p>
<p>In brief, Hyperbole lets you:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Quickly create typed hyperlink buttons either from the keyboard or by
dragging between a source and destination window with a mouse button
depressed.  Activate Hyperbole buttons by pressing/clicking on them or
by name;

</li><li> Activate many kinds of <em>implicit buttons</em> recognized by context
within text buffers, e.g. URLs, pathnames with section anchors, grep
output lines, and git commits.  A single key, <kbd>{M-<span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd>, or
mouse button automatically does the right thing in dozens of contexts;
just press and go;

</li><li> Build outlines with multi-level, numbered outline nodes, e.g. 1.4.8.6,
that all renumber automatically when any cell (node) or tree is moved
in the outline.  Each cell also has a permanent hyperlink anchor that
you can reference from any other cell;

</li><li> Manage all your contacts or record-based, unstructured texts quickly with
hierarchical categories; each entry can have embedded hyperbuttons of any
type.  Or create an archive of documents with hierarchical entries and use
the same search mechanism to quickly find any matching entry;

</li><li> Use single keys to easily manage your Emacs windows or frames and quickly
retrieve saved window and frame configurations;

</li><li> Search for things in your current buffers, in a directory tree or across
major web search engines with the touch of a few keys.

<span id="Manual-Overview-1"></span><h3 class="section">1.1 Manual Overview</h3>

<p>Hyperbole is an efficient, programmable hypertextual information management
system.  It is intended for everyday work on any GNU Emacs platform.
Hyperbole allows hypertext buttons to be embedded within unstructured and
structured files, mail messages and news articles.  It offers intuitive
keyboard and mouse-based control of information display within multiple
windows.  It also provides point-and-click access to Info manuals, ftp
archives, the World-Wide Web and much more.

<span id="index-Hyperbole-demo"></span>
<span id="index-demo-file"></span>
<span id="index-tutorial"></span>
<p>This is a reference manual with extensive details about Hyperbole use.  If
you prefer a simpler, more interactive introduction to Hyperbole, the
<samp>FAST-DEMO</samp> file included in the Hyperbole distribution demonstrates
many of Hyperbole&rsquo;s standard facilities without the need to read through this
reference manual.  The <samp>FAST-DEMO</samp> is a good way to rapidly understand
some of what Hyperbole can do for you.  Once Hyperbole is installed,
(see <a href="#Setup">Setup</a>), you can access the <samp>FAST-DEMO</samp> with the key sequence
<kbd>{C-h h d d}</kbd>.
</p>
<p>See <a href="#Glossary">Glossary</a>, for definitions of Hyperbole terms.  In some cases,
terms are not precisely defined within the body of this manual since they
are defined within the glossary.  Be sure to reference the glossary if a
term is unclear to you.  Although you need not have a keen understanding of
all of these terms, a quick scan of the glossary helps throughout Hyperbole
use.
</p>
<p>See <a href="#Setup">Setup</a>, for explanations of how to obtain, install, configure and load
Hyperbole for use.  This appendix includes information on user-level settings
that you may want to modify after you understand Hyperbole&rsquo;s basic operation.
</p>
<p>See <a href="#Suggestion-or-Bug-Reporting">Suggestion or Bug Reporting</a>, for instructions on how to ask a
question, suggest a feature or report a bug in Hyperbole.  A few commonly
asked questions are answered in this manual, see <a href="#Questions-and-Answers">Questions and Answers</a>.
If you are interested in classic articles on hypertext, see <a href="#References">References</a>.
</p>
<p>See <a href="#Smart-Keys">Smart Keys</a>, for an explanation of the innovative, context-sensitive
mouse and keyboard Action and Assist Keys offered by Hyperbole.  See <a href="#Smart-Key-Reference">Smart Key Reference</a>, for a complete reference on what the Action and Assist Keys
do in each particular context they recognize.  See <a href="#Smart-Key-Argument-Selection">Smart Key Argument Selection</a>, for how Hyperbole speeds selection of values when prompting for
arguments.
</p>
<p>Keep in mind as you read about using Hyperbole that in many cases, it
provides a number of overlapping interaction methods that support differing
work styles.  In such instances, you need learn only one technique that suits
you.
</p>
<p>See <a href="#Buttons">Buttons</a>, for an overview of Hyperbole buttons and how to use
them.  Hyperbole&rsquo;s action-oriented button support is enabled via the
global minor mode, <code>hyperbole-mode</code>.
</p>
<p>See <a href="#Menus">Menus</a>, for summaries of Hyperbole menu commands and how to use
the minibuffer-based menus that work on any display that Emacs supports.
</p>
<p>See <a href="#HyWiki">HyWiki</a>, for Hyperbole&rsquo;s markup-free, personal Wiki system for
note-taking and automatic WikiWord highlighting and hyperlinking.  It
extends Org mode.  HyWikiWord hyperlink buttons are automatically
enabled for wiki pages below <code>hywiki-directory</code>.  To enable them
in text buffers outside of this directory, enable the global minor
mode, <code>hywiki-mode</code>.
</p>
<p>See <a href="#HyNote">HyNote</a>, for a start on the very early stages of Hyperbole&rsquo;s
multi-format note taking system.  HyNote supports Org, Markdown,
Koutline and Emacs Outline file formats.  HyNote works in any buffer
where HyWiki support is active.
</p>
<p>See <a href="#HyControl">HyControl</a>, for how to quickly and interactively control what your
Emacs windows and frames display and where they appear.
</p>
<p>See <a href="#Koutliner">Koutliner</a>, for concept and usage information on the
autonumbered, hypertextual outliner.  It uses its own major mode.
See <a href="#Koutliner-Keys">Koutliner Keys</a>, for a full summary of the outliner commands
that are bound to keys.
</p>
<p>See <a href="#HyRolo">HyRolo</a>, for concept and usage information on the rapid lookup,
hierarchical, full-text record management system included with Hyperbole.
</p>
<p>See <a href="#Window-Configurations">Window Configurations</a>, for instructions on how to save and restore
the set of buffers and windows that appear within a frame.  This feature
lets you switch among working contexts easily, even on a dumb terminal.
Such configurations last throughout a single session of editor
usage only.

<span id="Motivation-1"></span><h3 class="section">1.2 Motivation</h3>

<p>Database vendors apply tremendous resources to help solve corporate
information management problems.  But the information that people deal
with in their everyday worklife is seldom stored away in neatly defined
database schemas.  Instead it is scattered among local and remote files,
e-mail messages, faxes, voice mail and web pages.
</p>
<p>The rise of the web has demonstrated how hypertext technologies can be used
to build massive organized repositories of scattered information.  But
assembling information for the web still remains a great challenge and the
data formats of the web are too structured to de&lsquo;al with the wide variety
of information that people process.  Modern web development requires the
use of many languages: HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.  This in itself prevents
its use as the prime means of organizing and interlinking the constant
flows of daily information.
</p>
<p>GNU Hyperbole takes a distinctly different approach.  It has its own
hypertext technology that can interface perfectly with web links but which
are much easier to create (simply drag from the source to the destination of
a link to create a new hyperlink).  Hyperbole hyperbuttons can link not only
to static information but can perform arbitrary actions (through the use of
button types written in a single, highly interactive language, Emacs Lisp).
Hyperbole adds all of this power to your written documents, e-mail, news
articles, contact management, outlines, directory listings, and much more.
Hyperbole works well with the very latest versions of GNU Emacs across every
editing and viewing mode in Emacs.  It&rsquo;s core hypertext capabilities operate
as a global minor mode available across most file types, unlike Org mode
which is its own structured file format.
</p>
<p>Unlock the power of GNU Hyperbole to make your information work for you.
One system.  One language.  One manual.  One solution.  Learn Hyperbole and
start moving further, faster.

<p>GNU Hyperbole (pronounced Ga-new Hi-per-bo-lee), or just Hyperbole, is
like Markdown for hypertext.  Hyperbole automatically recognizes dozens of
common, pre-existing patterns in any buffer regardless of mode and can
instantly activate them as hyperbuttons with a single key: email addresses,
URLs, grep -n outputs, programming backtraces, sequences of Emacs keys,
programming identifiers, Texinfo and Info cross-references, Org links,
Markdown links and on and on.  All you do is load Hyperbole and then your
text comes to life with no extra effort or complex formatting.
</p>
<p>Hyperbole includes easy-to-use, powerful hypertextual button types without
the need to learn a markup language.  Hyperbole&rsquo;s button types are written
in Lisp and can be wholly independent of the web, i.e. web links are one
type of Hyperbole link, not fundamental to its link architecture.
However, Hyperbole is a great assistant when editing HTML or Javascript or
when browsing web pages and links.
</p>
<p>Hyperbole comes pre-built with most of the implicit button types you will
need but with a little extra effort and a few lines of code (or even just
a few words), you can define your own implicit button types to recognize
your specific buttons and then activate them anywhere in Emacs.  You press
a single key, <kbd>{M-<span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> by default, on any kind of Hyperbole
button to activate it, so you can rely on your muscle memory and let the
computer do the hard work of figuring out what to do.  <kbd>{C-u
M-<span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> shows you what any button will do in any context before you
activate it, so you can always be sure of what you are doing when needed
or if someone emails you a button (Hyperbole allows embedding buttons
in email messages too).
</p>
<p>Hyperbole is something to be experienced and interacted with, not understood
from reading alone.  It installs normally as a single Emacs package with no
dependencies outside of built-in Emacs libraries, see <a href="#Installation">Installation</a>.  Most
of Hyperbole is a single global minor mode that you can activate and
deactivate at will.  And it can be uninstalled quickly as well if need be, so
there is no risk in giving it a spin.
</p>
<p>Once you have it installed, try the interactive demo with <kbd>{C-h h d d}</kbd>.
In fact, if you have Hyperbole loaded and you use the Emacs Info reader to
read this manual, you can press <kbd>{M-<span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> inside any of the brace
delimited series of keys you see in this document and Hyperbole will execute
them on-the-fly (easy keyboard-macro style buttons in any text).
</p>
<p>Hyperbole can dramatically increase your productivity and greatly reduce
the number of keyboard/mouse keys you&rsquo;ll need to work efficiently.
</p>
<p>Hyperbole consists of five parts.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><span><em>Buttons and Smart Keys</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>There are three categories of buttons:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><span><em>explicit buttons</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>may be added to documents with a simple drag between windows, no markup
language needed.  With two windows on screen, an explicit link button can be
created at point in the current buffer linking to the position in the other
window&rsquo;s buffer by pressing <kbd>{C-h h e l}</kbd>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><em>Implicit buttons</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>are patterns automatically recognized within existing text that perform
actions, e.g. bug#24568 displays the bug status information for that Emacs
bug number, without the need for any additional markup.  Implicit link
buttons can be added to documents with a simple drag between windows too.
</p>
<p>Or from the keyboard, With two windows on screen, an implicit link button
can be created at point in the current buffer linking to the position in
the other window&rsquo;s buffer by pressing <kbd>{C-h h i l}</kbd>.  Use <kbd>{M-1
C-h h i l}</kbd> instead to be prompted for a name for the implicit button.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><em>Global buttons</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>are buttons that are activated by name from anywhere within Emacs.  They may
be either explicit or named implicit buttons.  They are the named buttons
stored in the a user&rsquo;s personal button file, directly editable from the
minibuffer menu with <kbd>{C-h h b p}</kbd>.
</p>
<p>With two windows on screen, a global explicit link button can be created at
point in the current buffer linking to the position in the other window&rsquo;s
buffer by pressing <kbd>{C-h h g l}</kbd>.  Use <kbd>{C-u C-h h g l}</kbd> instead to
create a named global implicit button.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Buttons are activated by pressing <kbd>{M-<span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> on them, clicking them
with a dedicated mouse button, or by referencing them by name (global
buttons that can be activated regardless of what is on screen).  Users
create and activate Hyperbole buttons; see <a href="#Buttons">Buttons</a>.  Emacs Lisp
programmers can develop new button types and actions.  See <a href="#Creating-Types">Creating Types</a>.
</p>
<p>Hyperbole includes two special <em>Smart Keys</em>, the Action Key and the
Assist Key, that perform an extensive array of context-sensitive operations
across emacs usage, including activating and showing help for Hyperbole
buttons.  In many popular Emacs modes, they allow you to perform common,
sometimes complex operations without having to use a different key for each
operation.  Just press a Smart Key and the right thing happens.  The
mouse versions of these keys additionally allow for drag actions.  We
call these the Action Mouse and Action Assist keys or buttons.  See <a href="#Smart-Keys">Smart Keys</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><em>HyRolo</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>a powerful, hierarchical contact manager which anyone can use, is also
included.  It is easy to learn since it introduces only a few new
mechanisms and has a menu interface, which may be operated from the
keyboard or the mouse.  It may also be used for full-text searching
over any record-based information in any number of Org, Markdown,
Koutline or Emacs Outline files.  Hyperbole buttons may be embedded in
any records.  See <a href="#HyRolo">HyRolo</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><em>HyControl</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>the fastest, easiest-to-use window and frame control available for GNU
Emacs.  With just a few keystrokes, you can shift from
increasing a window&rsquo;s height by 5 lines to moving a frame by 220 pixels
or immediately moving it to a screen corner.  Text in each window or
frame may be enlarged or shrunk (zoomed) for easy viewing, plus many
other features; this allows Hyperbole to quickly control the way
information is presented on-screen.  See <a href="#HyControl">HyControl</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><em>Koutliner</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>an advanced outliner with multi-level autonumbering and permanent
identifiers attached to each outline node for use as hypertext link anchors,
per node properties and flexible view specifications that can be included in
links or used interactively.  See <a href="#Koutliner">Koutliner</a>.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><em>Hyperbole API</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>a set of programming libraries for system developers who want to integrate
Hyperbole with another user interface or as a back-end to a distinct system.
(All of Hyperbole is written in Emacs Lisp for ease of modification.  It has
been engineered for real-world usage and is well structured). See <a href="#Developing-with-Hyperbole">Developing with Hyperbole</a>.

<p>Hyperbole may be used simply for browsing through documents
pre-configured with Hyperbole buttons, in which case, you can safely
ignore most of the information in this manual.  Jump right into the
Hyperbole fast demonstration by typing <kbd>{C-h h d d}</kbd>, assuming Hyperbole
has been installed at your site.  If you need to install
Hyperbole, see <a href="#Setup">Setup</a>, for Hyperbole installation and configuration
information.  The demo offers a much less technical introduction to
Hyperbole by supplying good examples of use.

<span id="index-GNU-Emacs"></span>
<span id="index-C_002dh-t"></span>
<p>You likely will want to do more than browse with Hyperbole,
e.g. create your own buttons.  The standard Hyperbole button editing
user interface is Emacs-based, so a basic familiarity with the Emacs
editing model is useful.  The material covered in the Emacs
tutorial, normally bound to <kbd>{C-h t}</kbd>, is more than
sufficient as background.  See <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Glossary">Glossary</a> in <cite>the GNU Emacs Manual</cite>,
if some emacs-related terms are unfamiliar to you.
</p>
<span id="index-Hyperbole-features"></span>
<p>A Hyperbole user works with chunks of information that need to be
organized, interlinked, and processed.  Such chunks can be hyperbuttons,
address book contacts, items in an outline, or even database query
results.  Hyperbole does not enforce any particular hypertext or
information management model, but instead allows you to organize your
information in large or small chunks as you see fit.  The Hyperbole
outliner organizes information into hierarchies which may also contain
links to external information sources.  See <a href="#Koutliner">Koutliner</a>.
</p>
<p>Some of Hyperbole&rsquo;s most significant features are:
</p>
<ul>
<li> Buttons may link to information or may execute functions, such as
starting or communicating with external programs;

</li><li> A simple mouse drag from a button source location to its link
destination is often all that is needed to create a new link.
The keyboard can also be used to emulate such drags;

</li><li> Buttons may be embedded within electronic mail messages;

</li><li> Outlines allow rapid browsing, editing and movement of chunks of
information organized into trees (hierarchies);

</li><li> Other hypertext and information retrieval systems may be encapsulated
under a Hyperbole user interface (a number of samples are provided).
</li></ul>

<span id="index-Hyperbole-applications"></span>
<p>Typical Hyperbole applications include:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><span><em>personal information management</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>Hyperlinks provide a variety of views into an information space.  A
search facility locates hyperbuttons in context and permits quick
selection.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><em>documentation and code browsing</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>Cross-references may be embedded within documentation and code.  Existing
documentation may be augmented with point-and-click interfaces to link
code with associated design documents, or to permit direct access to the
definition of identifiers by selecting their names within code or
other documents.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><em>brainstorming</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>The Hyperbole outliner (see <a href="#Koutliner">Koutliner</a>) is an effective tool for
capturing ideas and then quickly reorganizing them in a meaningful way.
Links to related ideas are easy to create so the need to copy and
paste information is greatly reduced.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><em>help/training systems</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>Tutorials with buttons can show students how things work while
explaining the concepts, e.g. an introduction to the commands available
on a computer system.  This technique can be much more effective than
written documentation alone.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><em>archive managers</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>Programs that manage archives from incoming information streams may be
supplemented by having them add topic-based buttons that link to the
archive holdings.  Users can then search and create their own links to
archive entries.

capital letter.  Use <kbd>{Q}</kbd> (note this is capitalized) to quit from
the minibuffer menu while leaving Hyperbole enabled.  Use <kbd>{X}</kbd>
(note this is capitalized) to quit from the minibuffer menu and
disable Hyperbole&rsquo;s minor mode.
</p>
<p>Use <kbd>{C-h h d d}</kbd> for an interactive demonstration of standard
Hyperbole button capabilities.
</p>
<p>Type <kbd>{C-h h k e}</kbd> for an interactive demonstration of the Koutliner,
Hyperbole&rsquo;s multi-level autonumbered hypertextual outliner.
</p>
<p>To try out HyControl, Hyperbole&rsquo;s interactive frame and window control
system, use <kbd>{C-h h s w}</kbd> for window control or <kbd>{C-h h s f}</kbd> for
frame control.  Pressing <kbd>{t}</kbd> switches between window and frame
control once in HyControl.  Hyperbole also binds <kbd>{C-c \}</kbd> for quick
access to HyControl&rsquo;s window control menu if it was not already bound

<p>Mouse configuration of the Smart Keys is automatic for GNU Emacs under
Mac OS X, the X Window System and MS Windows, assuming your emacs program
has been built with support for any of these window systems.
</p>
<p>The <em>Action Mouse Key</em> is bound to your shift-middle mouse key (or
shift-left on a 2-button mouse).  The <em>Assist Mouse Key</em> is bound to your
shift-right mouse key, assuming Hyperbole is run under an external window
system.  These keys support <em>Drag Actions</em>, see <a href="#Smart-Mouse-Keys">Smart Mouse Keys</a>, as
well as the standard Smart Key presses.

<span id="index-hkey_002deither"></span>
<p>If you prefer other Smart Key bindings, simply bind the commands
<code>action-key</code> and <code>assist-key</code> to keyboard keys.
Hyperbole binds <kbd>{M-<span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> to the command <code>hkey-either</code>;
this provides a single key binding for both Smart Key commands; a prefix
argument, such as <kbd>{C-u}</kbd>, then invokes <code>assist-key</code> actions.
</p>
<p>You may also bind <code>action-mouse-key</code> and <code>assist-mouse-key</code> to
other mouse keys, though you won&rsquo;t be able to execute mouse drag actions with
such key bindings.  See <a href="#Smart-Mouse-Key-Drags">Smart Mouse Key Drags</a>, and see <a href="#Keyboard-Drags">Keyboard Drags</a>.
</p>
<p>To permanently change any of these key bindings, use:

<p>The Hyperbole Doc/SmartKeys menu entry, <kbd>{C-h h d s}</kbd>, displays a
summary of what the Smart Keys do in all of their different contexts.
Alternatively, a click of the Assist Mouse Key in the right corner of a
window modeline (within the rightmost 3 characters) toggles between
displaying this summary and hiding it.  Reference this summary whenever you
need it.
</p>
<p>The following table is the same summary.  Much of the browsing power
of Hyperbole comes from the use of the Smart Keys, so spend some time
practicing how to use them.  Study what modeline clicks and window
drag actions do as these will give you a lot of power without much
effort.  This table may appear daunting at first, but as you practice
and notice that the Smart Keys do just a few context-sensitive things
per editor mode, you will find it easy to just press or point and
click and let Hyperbole do the right thing in each context.

<span id="Smart-Key-Argument-Selection-1"></span><h3 class="section">3.3 Smart Key Argument Selection</h3>

<span id="index-Hyperbole-help"></span>
<p>A prime design criterion of Hyperbole&rsquo;s user interface is that you
should be able to see what an operation will do before using it.  The
Assist Key typically shows you what a button or minibuffer menu item
will do before you activate it.  Hyperbole also displays the result of
directly selecting an argument value with the Action Key, to provide
feedback as to whether the correct item has been selected.  A second
press/click is necessary before an argument is accepted and processed.
</p>
<span id="index-argument-entry"></span>
<span id="index-direct-selection"></span>
<span id="index-double-click"></span>
<p>Many Hyperbole commands prompt you for arguments.  The standard
Hyperbole user interface has an extensive core of argument types that
it recognizes.  Whenever Hyperbole is prompting you for an argument,
it knows the type that it needs and provides some error checking to
help you get it right.  More importantly, it allows you to press the
Action Key within an entity that you want to use as an argument.
Hyperbole will copy the appropriate thing to the minibuffer as the
argument.  If you press (click with a mouse) the Action Key on the
same thing again, e.g. within a list of possible completions,
Hyperbole exits the minibuffer and uses the current argument.  Thus, a
double click registers a desired argument.  Double-quoted strings,
pathnames, mail messages, Info nodes, dired listings, buffers,
numbers, completion items and so forth are all recognized at
appropriate times.  All of the argument types mentioned in the
documentation for the Emacs Lisp <code>interactive</code> function are
recognized.  Experiment a little and you will quickly get used to this
direct selection technique.
</p>
<span id="index-completion"></span>
<span id="index-Vertico-completion"></span>
<p>Wherever possible, standard Emacs completion is offered, as described
in <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Completion">Completion</a> in <cite>the GNU Emacs Manual</cite>.  Remember to use
<kbd>{?}</kbd>  to see what your possibilities for an argument are if
completions are not automatically shown to you.  Once you have a list
of possible completions on screen, press the Action Key twice on any
item to enter it as the argument.  If you are using the Vertico
completion library with completions displayed in the minibuffer,
selection of completions works the same as if they were displayed in a
separate buffer as in standard Emacs.
</p>
<span id="index-minibuffer-completion"></span>

<span id="index-Smart-Keys-in-minibuffer"></span>
<span id="index-Action-Key-in-minibuffer"></span>
<span id="index-Assist-Key-in-minibuffer"></span>
<p>Within the minibuffer itself, the Smart Keys are also
context-sensitive.  A press of the Action Key at the end of the
argument line tries to accept the argument and when successful, exits
the minibuffer.  A press of the Assist Key at the end of the argument
line displays matching completions for times when they are not
automatically displayed or need updating.  A press of the Action or
Assist Key on part of the argument, deletes from point to the end of
the line, expanding the set of available completions and redisplaying
them.

<p>Typically, <kbd>{C-h A}</kbd> and <kbd>{C-u C-h A}</kbd> which show Action and
Assist Key help for the current context, are sufficient for seeing how
the Smart Keys behave no matter where they are used.
</p>
<span id="index-C_002dh-h-c-d"></span>

<span id="index-troubleshooting-Smart-Keys"></span>
<span id="index-Messages-buffer"></span>
<span id="index-logging-Smart-Key-behavior"></span>
<p>However, if a Smart Key ever behaves differently than you think it
should or if you want to test how the Smart Keys respond in a new
context, then the Smart Key debugging flag may be of use.  You toggle
it on and off with <kbd>{C-h h c d}</kbd> (minibuffer menu
Cust/Debug-Toggle).  Once enabled, this displays a message in the
minibuffer each time the Action or Assist Key is released, showing
the context of the press and its associated action, so you can see
exactly what is happening whenever you use a Smart Key.  These
messages are all prefaced with &ldquo;(HyDebug)&rdquo; and logged to the
&ldquo;*Messages*&rdquo; buffer for later viewing.
</p>
<span id="index-C_002dh-h-m-c"></span>
<span id="index-C_002dh-h-m-r"></span>
<p>If you do find a problem with the Smart Keys and want to report a bug,
use <kbd>{C-h h m r}</kbd> to compose an email message to the bug-hyperbole
list.  Hyperbole will automatically include all of the &ldquo;(HyDebug)&rdquo;
messages from your current emacs session into your email.  Similarly,
when you compose an email to the hyperbole-users mailing list
with <kbd>{C-h h m c}</kbd>, these messages are also included.

<span id="index-smart-marking"></span>
<span id="index-region-selection"></span>
<span id="index-things"></span>
<span id="index-delimited-things"></span>
<p>Hyperbole has some radically cool ways to select regions of structured text
or source code and to copy or move them between buffers with a single mouse
drag or two key presses.  A great deal of smarts are built-in so that it
does the right thing most of the time; many other attempts at similar
behavior such as <samp>thing.el</samp> fail to deal with many file format
complexities.
</p>
<p>We use the term <em>things</em> to refer to structured entities that
Hyperbole can select.  These include: delimited pairs of (), {}, &lt;&gt;,
[] and quote marks, source code functions, source code comments and
matching tag pairs in HTML and SGML modes.  <em>Delimited things</em> are
those things that contain a selectable delimiter such as an opening
parenthesis.
</p>
<span id="index-HTML-tag-pair"></span>
<span id="index-SGML-tag-pair"></span>
<span id="index-XML-tag-pair"></span>
<p>The best way to mark a delimited thing is to move your cursor to the
starting delimiter of the thing and then press the Action Key.
Typically, you will see the thing highlight.  You can then operate
upon it as you would any Emacs region.  In many cases, you can do the
same thing upon the closing delimiter, but this is not as reliable.
An Action Key press on the start of an HTML, XML, or SGML tag pair
marks the entire region span of the pair.  If you use the Assist Key
instead, it will mark and kill (delete) the thing.
</p>
<span id="index-drag_002c-with-region"></span>
<span id="index-kill-region"></span>
<span id="index-yank-region"></span>
<span id="index-cut-region"></span>
<span id="index-copy-region"></span>
<span id="index-paste-region"></span>
<p>Even better are Smart Mouse Key thing drags which let you copy or move
delimited things in one operation without having to select a region.  To
copy, simply drag with the Action Key from a thing&rsquo;s opening delimiter
and release somewhere outside of the thing, either within the same
window or within another window.  The thing will be copied to the
point of release.  If you want to move a thing, simply perform the
same drag but with the Assist Mouse Key.  Ensure that you do not move
any explicit buttons from one buffer to another as that does not
work.
</p>
<p>Hyperbole also binds two convenience keys for working with things.
</p>
<span id="index-C_002dc-RET"></span>
<span id="index-hui_002dselect_002dthing"></span>
<span id="index-hui_002dselect_002dthing_002dwith_002dmouse"></span>
<p>The first such key is <kbd>{C-c <span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> <code>hui-select-thing</code> which
selects bigger and bigger syntactic regions with each successive use.
Double or triple clicks of the Selection Key (left mouse key) do the same
thing.  The first press selects a region based upon the character at point.
For example, with point over an opening or closing grouping character, such
as { or }, the whole grouping is selected, e.g. a C function.  When on an
_ or - within a programming language identifier name, the whole name is
selected.  The type of selection is displayed in the minibuffer as
feedback.  When using a language in which indentation determines nesting
level like Python, a double click on the first alpha character of a line,
such as an if statement, selects the current clause (until the next line at
the same or lesser indentation).  Use <kbd>{C-g}</kbd> to unmark the region when
done.  Use, <code>hui-select-thing-with-mouse</code> if you want to bind this to
a different mouse key to use single clicks instead of double clicks.
</p>
<p>This key defers to any currently active <code>major-mode</code> which also
binds it.
</p>
<span id="index-C_002dc-_002e"></span>
<span id="index-hui_002dselect_002dgoto_002dmatching_002dtag"></span>
<p>The second convenience key is bound in HTML/XML/SGML/web
modes.  <kbd>{C-c .}</kbd> <code>hui-select-goto-matching-tag</code> jumps between
the opening and closing tag of a pair.  It moves point to the start of
the tag paired with the closest tag that point is within or which it
precedes.  A second press moves point to the matching tag of the pair,
allowing you to quickly jump back and forth between opening and
closing tags.
</p>
<p>This key defers to any currently active <code>major-mode</code> which also
binds it.

<span id="Smart-Mouse-Key-Modeline-Clicks-1"></span><h3 class="section">3.6 Smart Mouse Key Modeline Clicks</h3>

<p>Smart Mouse Key clicks on a window&rsquo;s modeline offer many powerful browsing
features, including directory editing (dired), user manual browsing, and
window, buffer and frame selection.  Generally, only Hyperbole-specific
modeline actions are discussed herein.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Leftmost Character

<span id="index-bury-buffer"></span>
<span id="index-unbury-buffer"></span>
<span id="index-modeline_002c-bury-buffer"></span>
<span id="index-modeline_002c-unbury-buffer"></span>
<span id="index-modeline_002c-leftmost-character"></span>
<p>Action Key clicks on the first (usually blank) character of the
modeline bury the current buffer in the buffer list and display the
next buffer in the list.  Assist Key clicks do the reverse and unbury
the bottom buffer.
</p>
<span id="index-modeline_002c-next-buffer"></span>
<span id="index-modeline_002c-prev-buffer"></span>
<p>A similar effect can be achieved with the standard Emacs mouse 1 (left) and
3 (right) buttons on the Buffer ID element of modeline to cycle through
previous and next buffers, respectively.  This may be easier to use since
you can click anywhere on the buffer identifier.
</p>
</li><li> Buffer ID Element

<span id="index-dired"></span>
<span id="index-directory-editor"></span>
<span id="index-dired_002djump"></span>
<span id="index-modeline_002c-dired"></span>
<span id="index-buffer-id"></span>
<span id="index-modeline_002c-buffer-id"></span>
<span id="index-dragging-items_002c-dired"></span>
<p>On the left part of the modeline is the buffer identification,
generally the name of the buffer in use.  An Action Key click on that
switches the window to edit the buffer&rsquo;s directory using dired.
Then Action Key clicks on directory items in the dired buffer display the
items selected in other windows.  An Action Key drag from an item to
another window displays the item in that window.
</p>
<p>An Action Key click on the first line in a dired buffer which contains
the current directory path, specifically on any ancestor part of the
path (the part to the left of the click point), starts another dired
session on the ancestor directory.  Click at the end of this line or
on the last line to end the dired session (bury its buffer).
</p>
<span id="index-Treemacs"></span>
<span id="index-file-viewer_002c-Treemacs"></span>
<p>If you use the Treemacs file viewer Emacs package, you can configure Hyperbole
to use this instead of Dired when you click on a modeline buffer id.
</p>
<p>Since this is a customization option, it may be changed permanently like so.
Use <kbd>{M-x customize-set-variable <span class="key">RET</span> action-key-modeline-buffer-id-function <span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd>.
Change the value to <code>smart-treemacs-modeline</code>.  Then press <tt class="key">RET</tt>.  To change it back
to Hyperbole&rsquo;s default, use the value, <code>dired-jump</code>.

<p>An Action Mouse Key click in a blank area of a window modeline (away
from left and right edges) toggles between displaying and hiding a
list of all buffers.  Once displayed, an Action Key click on a buffer
item will display it in another window.  You can drag items to specific
windows for display as well.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, you may (1) display the buffer menu, (2) use its <kbd>{m}</kbd>
command to mark buffers, and (3) use the Hyperbole <kbd>{@}</kbd> command to
display the marked buffers in a grid of popup windows whose number of
rows and columns you specify at the prompt or via a prefix argument.
This also works in <code>ibuffer-menu</code> and <code>dired</code> modes.
See <a href="#HyControl">HyControl</a>.
</p>
<p>An Assist Key click in the blank area of the modeline displays a quick
access menu of display-oriented commands.  You can jump to buffers
categorized by major mode, jump to windows by buffer name, or to
frames by name.  Manage your windows and frames quickly with this menu
as well.  As always with Hyperbole, just try it and you&rsquo;ll begin to
wonder how you lived without it before.

<p>A click of the Action Mouse Key in the right corner of a window
modeline (within the rightmost 3 characters) displays or hides the
GNU Info Manual Browser, giving you quick point and click access to
an amazing wealth of documentation, since the Action Key also browses
through these manuals and follows their hyperlinked cross-references.
A click of the Assist Key in the same location displays or hides the
Smart Key summary, as noted earlier.

<span id="index-hmouse_002dcontext_002dibuffer_002dmenu"></span>
<span id="index-ibuffer-menu"></span>
<p>Hyperbole modeline mouse click actions are controlled by the two functions,
<code>action-key-modeline</code> and <code>assist-key-modeline</code>.  If you know
a little Emacs Lisp you can change these to do whatever you like.  When a
Smart Key press is on a blank part of a modeline but not at the left or
right, the function given by one of these two variables is
executed: <code>action-key-modeline-function</code> or
<code>assist-key-modeline-function</code>.  By default, the Action Key toggles
between displaying and hiding the buffer menu.  If you like the more
advanced features of <code>Ibuffer Mode</code>, you can change the buffer menu to
use that with the following in your Emacs initialization file:
<code>(setq action-key-modeline-function #'hmouse-context-ibuffer-menu)</code>.
To set it back to the default use:
<code>(setq action-key-modeline-function #'hmouse-context-menu)</code>.
</p>
<span id="index-hui_002dmenu_002dscreen_002dcommands"></span>
<span id="index-modeline_002c-screen-command-menu"></span>
<p>The default <code>assist-key-modeline-function</code> is to pop up a menu of
convenient screen commands that lets you select buffers grouped by
major mode, use HyControl, or jump to specific windows, window
configurations or frames.
</p>
<p>Since these are customization options, they may be change permanently like so.
Use <kbd>{M-x customize-set-variable <span class="key">RET</span> assist-key-modeline-function <span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd>.
Change the value to your desired command.  Then press <tt class="key">RET</tt>.

<p>Horizontal and vertical drags of the Smart Mouse Keys are used to split and
delete Emacs windows.
</p>
<p>An Action Mouse Key horizontal drag of five or more characters in either
direction within a single window creates a new window by splitting the
current window into two windows, one atop the other.  An Action Mouse Key
vertical drag in either direction splits the current window into two
side-by-side windows.  A horizontal or vertical drag of the Assist Mouse
Key within a single window, deletes that window.

<p>A window configuration consists of the set of windows within a single Emacs
frame.  This includes their locations, buffers, and the scrolled positions of
their buffers.
</p>
<p>Hyperbole allows you to save and restore window configurations with simple
diagonal mouse drags within a single window.  A diagonal drag in any
direction of the Action Key saves the current window configuration to a
ring of window configurations, just like the Emacs text kill ring.
See <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Kill-Ring">Kill Ring</a> in <cite>the Emacs Manual</cite>.  Each diagonal drag in any
direction of the Assist Key restores a prior saved window configuration
from the ring.  Window configurations are restored in reverse order of the
way they were saved.  Since a ring is circular, after the oldest element is
restored, the newest element will again be restored and so on.

<p>Emacs windows may be resized by dragging their window separators
(modelines or vertical side lines) within a frame.  Simply depress either
Smart Mouse Key on a non-bottommost modeline or near a window side, hold
it down while you drag to a new location and then release.  The window
separator will move to the location of release.  Basically, just drag the
window separator to where you want it.  Drags from a blank area of a
modeline show visible feedback as the window is resized.

<p>Swapping buffer locations is quick and easy with Hyperbole.  Simply drag
the Assist Mouse Key (not the Action Key) from the open area of one
window&rsquo;s modeline to the text area of another.  This works across frames
as well.
</p>
<p>If you have precisely two windows in an Emacs frame, you can swap their buffers
from the keyboard.  Use this Hyperbole minibuffer menu key sequence
involving the tilde key to swap the buffers and quit from the Hyperbole
minibuffer menu: <kbd>{C-h h s w ~ Q}</kbd>.  Similarly, if you have two single
window frames, you can swap buffers between them with <kbd>{C-h h s f ~
Q}</kbd>.

<p>What if you want to display the same buffer in another window and not swap

the source window and drag to the text area of the destination window.
Voila, the buffer appears in the new location as well as the old one.
</p>
<p>If you want a new window where you release (so the original
destination window&rsquo;s buffer stays onscreen), just drag to the release
window&rsquo;s modeline; that window will be split before the buffer is

<p>You can also drag items to other windows with the Action or Assist Mouse
Keys in Dired, Buffer Menu, Ibuffer and Treemacs listing buffers, rather
than the buffers themselves.  Dragging Hyperbole buttons to display their
referents in another window works too.
</p>
<p>Drag with the Action or Assist Mouse Key and the selected item&rsquo;s referent
will be displayed in any Emacs window in which you release.  Drag outside
Emacs and it will be displayed in a new frame.  To display the last item
you want within the listing window itself, press and release the Action
Key on that item after dragging your other items to their respective
windows.  Remember that you can emulate these drags from the keyboard when
needed, see <a href="#Keyboard-Drags">Keyboard Drags</a>.
</p>
<p>So now you can put a bunch of buffers and files on your screen wherever
you like.  Typically, a brief visual pulse is shown first at the source
item and then in the destination window, to help you see that the transfer
has been made.  An Assist Key drag will move the the item list buffer to
the destination (swapping buffers), just as it does with other buffers.

<span id="index-keyboard-drags"></span>
<p>If you run Emacs under a window system and there is no prior key binding
on <kbd>{M-o}</kbd> when you load Hyperbole, then many Smart Key drags can be
emulated from the keyboard.  To do so, press <kbd>{M-o}</kbd>, the
<code>hkey-operate</code> command, at the button source location, move to the
link destination, e.g. with <kbd>{C-x o}</kbd>, and then press <kbd>{M-o}</kbd>
again.  This simulates a depress and release of the Action Key.
<kbd>{C-u M-o}</kbd> emulates drags of the Assist Key.  This will not work when
Hyperbole is run from a dumb terminal Emacs session since drag actions
are not supported without a window system.

<span id="index-window-by-letter"></span>
<span id="index-jump-to-window-by-letter"></span>
<span id="index-keyboard_002c-jump-to-window"></span>
<p>For even faster keyboard-based display of items and drag emulations,
use the Emacs package <code>ace-window</code>
(see <a href="https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/ace-window.html">https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/ace-window.html</a>).
</p>
<p>The <em>ace-window</em> package assigns short letter IDs to each Emacs
window and lets you jump to or operate upon a specific window by giving
its ID.  Hyperbole can add commands to ace-window that replace the
two-step drag emulation key described above with a single key sequence
that does not require moving to the drag target window since it is
specified by ID as part of the command.
</p>
<p>To enable this feature, in your Emacs initialization file after Hyperbole
is initialized, if you do not have a key bound for <code>ace-window</code>,
then call: <code>(hkey-ace-window-setup \&quot;\M-o\&quot;)</code> to bind it to
<kbd>{M-o}</kbd>, replacing Hyperbole&rsquo;s default <code>hkey-operate</code> command
there (because ace-window can emulate the drags performed by
<code>hkey-operate</code>).  If you already have a key bound for
<code>ace-window</code>, then just ensure it is initialized by calling
<code>(hkey-ace-window-setup)</code> without a key argument.

<p>After setup, the leftmost character or two of each window&rsquo;s modeline
will show the ID to type to use that window as the drag destination.
Then whenever point is on an item you want displayed in another
window, use <kbd>{M-o i &lt;id-of-window-to-display-item-in&gt;}</kbd> and watch
the magic happen.  If you want to display multiple items in different
windows, instead use the <kbd>{M-o t
&lt;id-of-window-to-display-item-in&gt;}</kbd> key sequence to <em>throw</em> the
item to the window.  To <em>replace</em> the selected window&rsquo;s buffer
with that of another window, use <kbd>{M-o r
&lt;id-of-window-displaying-desired-buffer&gt;}</kbd>.  To instead <em>swap</em> the
selected window&rsquo;s buffer with that of another window, use <kbd>{M-o m

<span id="index-hui_003aibut_002dlink_002ddirectly"></span>
<p>And finally, to create a new, <em>unnamed</em> implicit link in the
selected window that refers to the location in the other window, use
<kbd>{M-o w &lt;referent-window-id&gt;}</kbd>.  This executes <code>hui:ibut-link-directly</code>
which determines the link type by using the referent context.  To create
a <em>named</em> implicit link button in the selected window, use
<kbd>{M-1 M-o w &lt;window&gt;}</kbd>.  It prompts for the name and then links to
the referent window location.  If you highlight a region
before invoking this, Hyperbole will use that as the name for the
implicit button.

<span id="index-hui_003aebut_002dlink_002ddirectly"></span>
<p>To create an explicit button the same way, use <kbd>{C-u M-o w
&lt;window-id&gt;}</kbd>.  This executes <code>hui:ebut-link-directly</code>, prompts for
any needed arguments, determines the link type by using the referent
context and then creates the explicit button.  If you highlight a region
before invoking this, Hyperbole will use that as the name for the
explicit button.

t &lt;window-id&gt;}</kbd>.  If you don&rsquo;t use region highlighting,
i.e. <code>transient-mark-mode</code>, then use <kbd>{C-u M-o
t &lt;window-id&gt;}</kbd> for the same effect.  The buffer in the target window
must differ from the one in the source window.  With no region active,
this command throws the source buffer to the target window.

<span id="Buttons-1"></span><h2 class="chapter">4 Buttons</h2>

<span id="index-button"></span>
<p>This chapter explains use of Hyperbole <em>buttons</em>.  There are several
kinds of Hyperbole buttons: buttons that are created one at a time and
stored in files (<em>explicit buttons</em>); buttons that can be
activated by name anytime (<em>global buttons</em>); and buttons defined
by textual patterns where one definition can create an infinite number
of buttons (<em>implicit buttons</em>).
</p>
<p>Hyperbole buttons are embedded within textual documents; they may be
created, modified, moved or deleted.  Each button performs a specific
action, such as linking to a file or executing a shell command.
</p>
<span id="index-button_002c-explicit"></span>
<span id="index-button_002c-global"></span>
<span id="index-button_002c-implicit"></span>
<span id="index-button-category"></span>
<span id="index-explicit-button"></span>
<span id="index-global-button"></span>
<span id="index-implicit-button"></span>
<p>There are three categories of Hyperbole buttons:
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt><span><em>explicit buttons</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>created by Hyperbole, accessible from within a single document;
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><em>global buttons</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>created by Hyperbole, specific to each user, and accessible anywhere
within a user&rsquo;s network of documents;
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><em>implicit buttons</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>created and managed by other programs or embedded within the structure
of a document, accessible from within a single document.  Hyperbole
recognizes implicit buttons by contextual patterns given in their type
specifications (explained later).
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Explicit Hyperbole buttons may be embedded within any type of text file.
Implicit buttons may appear only within document contexts allowed by
their types, which may limit the kinds of documents or the locations
within those documents at which such buttons may be found.  All global
buttons for a user are stored in a single location and are activated by
typing their names, rather than by direct selection, the means used to
activate explicit and implicit buttons.
</p>
<p>To summarize:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">Button Category   Active Within        Activation Means      Managed By
========================================================================
Explicit          a single document    direct selection      Hyperbole
Global            any document         typing its name       Hyperbole
Implicit          a matching context   direct selection      other tools

</pre></div>

<span id="index-terminal-use"></span>
<p>A click on a Hyperbole button may activate it or describe its actions,
depending on which mouse key is used.  Buttons may also be activated from a
keyboard.  (In fact, many Hyperbole operations, including menu usage, may
be performed from any standard character terminal interface, so you need
not be anchored to a desktop all day).  See <a href="#Smart-Keys">Smart Keys</a>.  There is
also a key that shows you how a button will behave before you activate
it, see <a href="#Smart-Key-Operations">Smart Key Operations</a>.

<span id="Explicit-Buttons-1"></span><h3 class="section">4.1 Explicit Buttons</h3>

<span id="index-explicit-button-1"></span>
<span id="index-button_002c-explicit-1"></span>
<span id="index-button-label"></span>
<span id="index-button-name"></span>
<span id="index-label_002c-button"></span>
<span id="index-name_002c-button"></span>
<p>Hyperbole creates and manages <em>explicit buttons</em> which perform
specific actions when activated (typically through a button press).
They look like this &lsquo;<samp>&lt;(fake button)&gt;</samp>&rsquo;.  They are quickly
recognizable, yet relatively non-distracting as you scan the text in
which they are embedded.  The text between the &lsquo;<samp>&lt;(</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>)&gt;</samp>&rsquo;
delimiters is called the <em>button label</em> or <em>button name</em>.
Spacing between words within a button label is irrelevant to Hyperbole.
Button labels may wrap across several lines without causing a problem;
just be sure to select the first line of the button to activate it.
</p>
<p>Explicit buttons may be added to any editable buffer including temporary
buffers without any attached files (such buttons will last only the
length of a single Emacs session).  For source code files, simply place
Hyperbole explicit buttons within comments.  Buttons that you use for
quick navigation to websites or other things you do often should be
added to your personal button file.  See <a href="#Button-Files">Button Files</a>.
</p>
<span id="index-button_002c-moving"></span>
<span id="index-moving-buttons"></span>
<p>Explicit buttons may be freely moved about within the buffer in which
they are created.  (No present support exists for moving buttons between
buffers).  A single button may also appear multiple times within the
same buffer; simply copy the button label with its delimiters to a new
location if you need another copy of it.
</p>
<p>For details on how to create, activate, delete or edit explicit
buttons, see <a href="#Utilizing-Explicit-Buttons">Utilizing Explicit Buttons</a>.
</p>
<span id="index-link-button-1"></span>
<span id="index-referent"></span>
<p>Each explicit button is assigned an action type that determines the
actions it performs.  Hyperbole includes its own set of useful action
types but any named, interactive Emacs Lisp command may be used.  For
example, <em>Link action types</em> connect buttons to particular types
of <em>referents</em>, the targets of their links.  Link action type
names all begin with <code>link-</code>.  Link action button referents are
displayed when such buttons are activated with a press or a click.
See <a href="#Action-Types">Action Types</a>, for a list of Hyperbole action types, including
link types.
</p>
<span id="index-linking_002c-in_002dplace"></span>
<span id="index-Hyperbole-data-model"></span>
<p>Hyperbole does not manage referent data; this is left to the
applications that generate the data.  This means that Hyperbole
provides in-place linking and does not require reformatting data to
integrate it with Hyperbole.
</p>
<span id="index-button-data"></span>
<span id="index-button-attribute"></span>
<span id="index-file_002c-_002ehypb"></span>
<p>Hyperbole stores the <em>button data</em> that gives an explicit button its
behavior, separately from the button label, in a file named
<samp>.hypb</samp> (<samp>_hypb</samp> under MS Windows) within the same directory
as the file in which the button is created.  Thus, all files in the
same directory share a common button data file.  Button data is
comprised of individual <em>button attribute</em> values.  A user never
sees this data in its raw form but may see a formatted version by
asking for help on a button.

<span id="index-label_002c-button-1"></span>
<p>Sometimes it is useful to activate buttons without regard to the
information with which you are working.  In such instances, you use
<em>global buttons</em>, which are buttons that may be activated or
otherwise operated upon by typing their names/labels when they are
prompted for, rather than selecting the buttons within a buffer.  In
contrast, activation of explicit buttons depends upon the information on
your screen since they are accessible only from within their particular
buffers.
</p>
<p>If you want a permanent link to a file section that you can follow at
any time, you can use a global button.  Or what about an Emacs keyboard
macro that you use frequently?  Create a global button with an action type
of <code>exec-kbd-macro</code> button and an easy to type name.  Then you can
activate it whenever the need arises.
</p>
<span id="index-C_002dh-h-g"></span>
<span id="index-menu_002c-Gbut"></span>
<span id="index-menu_002c-Global_002dButton"></span>
<p>Global buttons are managed with the Hyperbole Gbut/ menu accessed with
<kbd>{C-h h g}</kbd>.  The Create item, <kbd>{C-h h g c}</kbd>, prompts for a
global button name, an action type, and the action&rsquo;s associated
arguments, such as a file to which to link.  It then creates the button.
To activate the button, use the Act menu item, <kbd>{C-h h g a}</kbd>.  Type
the button&rsquo;s name, press <kbd>{<span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd>, and then Hyperbole prompts
you for its action type and associated arguments.  <kbd>{C-h h g e}</kbd> to
edit an existing global button.  To remove a button, use the Delete menu
item, <kbd>{C-h h g d}</kbd>; see <a href="#Deletion">Deletion</a>.
</p>
<span id="index-global-link-creation"></span>
<span id="index-creating-global-links"></span>
<span id="index-menu-item_002c-Gbut_002fLink"></span>
<span id="index-C_002dh-h-g-l"></span>
<p>To create a global button that links to point in one of your Emacs
windows, use the Link menu item, <kbd>{C-h h g l}</kbd>.
</p>
<p>By default this will create a global explicit link button.  Give it a
prefix argument to create a global implicit link button.
</p>
<p>With a single window visible on-screen or a single window within your
current frame, this will prompt you for a button name or label
(temporarily showing you your global/personal button file) and then
will insert a button that links to the current point within that window.
</p>
<p>If you have exactly two Emacs windows in your current frame or exactly
two windows visible across two Emacs frames, then the link referent will
be to the point in the other, non-selected window.
</p>
<p>With more than two windows on screen, Hyperbole will prompt you to
choose the referent window and its associated point to which to link.
If the Ace Window package is installed and active, this will be used
to choose the window via keyboard; otherwise, you will be prompted to
select it by mouse.
</p>
<p>Global buttons are actually explicit buttons stored at the end of your
personal button file, see <a href="#Button-Files">Button Files</a>.  You can always go into that
file and activate, edit or annotate these buttons with comments.
</p>
<span id="index-bookmarks"></span>
<p>Emacs has a built-in feature similar to Global Buttons called
Bookmarks.  Bookmarks store places in files or link to URLs, so they
are more limited than Hyperbole&rsquo;s global buttons and cannot utilize
all of Hyperbole&rsquo;s capabilities for performing actions.  Hyperbole has
an action type, <code>link-to-bookmark</code>, for using an Emacs bookmark
as a Hyperbole button referent.  See <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Bookmarks">Bookmarks</a> in <cite>the Emacs
Manual</cite>, for details on bookmarks.

<span id="index-button_002c-implicit-1"></span>
<span id="index-implicit-button-1"></span>
<span id="index-link_002dto_002dfile"></span>
<p>Hyperbole can recognize and activate <em>implicit buttons</em> within
documents that require no special markup, e.g. pathnames or URLs, and
many other types.  For example, an Action Key press on a web URL will
display its link in a browser, regardless of the format of the
document.  Similarly, an Action Key press on an email address starts
composing mail to that address.
</p>
<span id="index-implicit-button-type"></span>
<p>Implicit buttons are identified by implicit button type contextual
pattern matchers that identify appropriate textual patterns at point.
An <em>implicit button type</em> utilizes Emacs Lisp to identify a
pattern or state that when matched triggers an <em>action</em>
associated with the implicit button type.  The action is specified by
either a Hyperbole action type (see <a href="#Action-Types">Action Types</a>) or an Emacs Lisp
command.  Implicit button types may use the same action types that
explicit buttons use.  As an example, the pathname implicit button
type matches to any existing local filename or directory name and its
action type, <code>link-to-file</code>, displays the associated file or
directory, typically in another window.  An explicit button could do
the same thing but has to be created manually, rather than recognized
as part of the buffer text.

<span id="index-C_002dh-h-i-c"></span>
<span id="index-C_002dh-h-i-e"></span>
<p>Implicit buttons are managed with the Hyperbole Ibut/ menu accessed
with <kbd>{C-h h i}</kbd>.  The Create item, <kbd>{C-h h i c}</kbd>, prompts for
an implicit button name (default is any selected region), an action
type, and the action&rsquo;s associated arguments.  It then creates the
button at point.  Use this to create a button with any implicit button
type, not just links.
</p>
<span id="index-mouse-drag_002c-implicit-link-creation"></span>
<span id="index-drag"></span>
<span id="index-Action-Key-drag"></span>
<p>Alternatively, to create an implicit link button to something
displayed within an Emacs window (the referent), simply drag with the
Action Mouse Key depressed from an editable source window to another
window with the desired link referent and then release.  The drag must
start outside of a draggable item, see <a href="#Displaying-Items">Displaying Items</a>.
Hyperbole will either automatically select the button type based on
the referent context or will prompt you to select from one of a few
possible link types.
</p>
<span id="index-implicit-link-creation"></span>
<span id="index-menu-item_002c-Ibut_002fLink"></span>
<span id="index-C_002dh-h-i-l"></span>
<p>If you have exactly two Emacs windows in your current frame or exactly
two windows visible across two Emacs frames, this is even easier.
Simply use the Link menu item, <kbd>{C-h h i l}</kbd>, to create a new
unnamed implicit link button or to edit the one at point.  <kbd>{C-u
C-h h i l}</kbd> will additionally prompt to add a name or rename the button
at point.  With more than two windows, Hyperbole will prompt you to
choose the referent window and its associated point to which to link.
If the Ace Window package is installed and active, this will be used
to choose the window via keyboard; otherwise, you will be prompted to
select it by mouse.

<p>To activate an implicit button with point on its name or button text,
use the Act menu item, <kbd>{C-h h i a}</kbd> or press the Action Key.  You
can use <kbd>{C-h h i e}</kbd> to edit an implicit button (or simply edit it
manually).  If you want to add a name to an existing implicit button
without one, use <kbd>{C-h h i n}</kbd> to name it.  Rename an existing
named implicit button with <kbd>{C-h h i r}</kbd>.
</p>
<span id="index-file_002c-hibtypes_002eel"></span>
<span id="index-context"></span>
<span id="index-boolean-expressions"></span>
<p>Unlike explicit buttons, implicit buttons have no individual button
data other than their text and optional labels.  You use implicit
button types which include boolean expressions (predicates) that match
to both the label and the context required of any button of the type.
Each time a Smart Key is pressed at a location, Hyperbole evaluates
the predicates from the list of implicit button types and the first
one that evaluates true is selected and its associated action is
triggered.
</p>
<p>All of this happens transparently and is easy to use once you try it.
The Hyperbole Smart Keys offer additional extensive context-sensitive
point-and-click type behavior beyond implicit button types.  See <a href="#Smart-Key-Operations">Smart Key Operations</a>.

<span id="index-implicit-button-names"></span>
<span id="index-labeling-implicit-buttons"></span>
<span id="index-naming-implicit-buttons"></span>
<p>Individual implicit buttons may be labeled/named, allowing activation
by name or use as a link target by other buttons.  Such names are
highlighted similarly to explicit button names.  Here is a pathname
button with a label of &rsquo;My Emacs Files&rsquo;:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">&lt;[My Emacs Files]&gt;: &quot;~/.emacs.d&quot;
</pre></div>

<p>The name is delimited by &lsquo;<samp>&lt;[</samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp>]&gt;</samp>&rsquo; and can be followed
by any number of :, - or = separator characters, including none.

<span id="Action-Buttons-1"></span><h4 class="subsection">4.3.2 Action Buttons</h4>

<span id="index-action-button-1"></span>
<span id="index-implicit-action-button"></span>
<p>Explicit buttons all use the same syntax and store their action data
in a file separate from the button source file.  Implicit buttons have
no external data but use a unique syntax per implicit button type to
recognize the action to run.
</p>
<p>For times when you need a cross between the two, with a universal
button syntax and all button data stored in the button source file,
there are <em>action buttons</em>.
</p>
<span id="index-ert-tests-1"></span>
<p><em>Action Buttons</em> are a form of implicit buttons that can execute any
existing action types, Emacs Lisp functions, Emacs Regression Tests (ERT
tests) or display the values of Emacs Lisp variables and constants.  Such
buttons are delimited by angle brackets, &lt; &gt;, and come in four types:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><span><em>action type invocations</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>These begin with an action type name (from the list displayed by
<kbd>{C-h h d t a <span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd>) and are followed by any needed arguments
to form the action, e.g.
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">&lt;link-to-file-line &quot;${hyperb:dir}/hact.el&quot; 40&gt;
</pre></div>

</dd>
<dt><span><em>function calls</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>These are similar to action type invocations but begin with an Emacs
Lisp function name rather than an action type name, e.g.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">&lt;find-file-other-window &quot;/tmp&quot;&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>Generally, such functions are invoked for their side-effects and their
return value is silently ignored.  But if a function is a boolean
predicate whose name ends in &lsquo;<samp>-p</samp>&rsquo;, then the result is displayed
in the minibuffer.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><em>test executions</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>Each of these consists solely of the name of an ERT test defined with
<code>ert-deftest</code> and surrounded by angle brackets, e.g.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">&lt;hbut-tests-ibut-insert-kbd-key&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>The above example runs a Hyperbole regression test when activated and
shows the pass/fail result in a pop-up buffer.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><em>variable displays</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>These consist of an Emacs Lisp variable name only.  They display
messages with their variable name and value, e.g.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">&lt;fill-column&gt;
</pre></div>

<p>If there is a function binding with the same name as the variable you
wish to display, to prevent interpretation as a function call
action button, precede the name with a <code>$</code>, e.g.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">&lt;$fill-column&gt;
</pre></div>

</dd>
</dl>

<p>With action buttons you need not remember any special syntax for each
type of implicit button.  You can freely embed them in any type of
text and use the Action and Assist keys on them as you do with any
other type of implicit button.
</p>
<p>An action button is recognized only if the first name within the angle
brackets is an existing action type or Emacs Lisp symbol.  Otherwise,
other implicit button types will be tested and may activate instead.
</p>
<p>To activate a frequently used action button by name independent of
your current buffer, simply add it to your global button file and
precede it with a label <kbd>{C-h h i l}</kbd>.  Then invoke it by label
name with: <kbd>{C-h h g a}</kbd>.

<span id="Button-Files-1"></span><h3 class="section">4.4 Button Files</h3>

<span id="index-button-files"></span>
<p>It is often convenient to create files filled with buttons as a means
of navigating distributed information pools or for other purposes.
These files can also serve as useful roadmaps that guide a user
through both unfamiliar and highly familiar information spaces.  Files
that are created specifically for this purpose are
called <em>Hyperbole button files</em>.
</p>
<span id="index-hbmap_003afilename"></span>
<span id="index-button-file_002c-personal"></span>
<span id="index-button-file_002c-directory"></span>
<p>The Hyperbole menu system provides quick access to two types of these
button files: personal and directory-specific, through the ButFile menu.
(The variable, <code>hbmap:filename</code>, contains the base name of these
button files.  Its standard value is <samp>HYPB</samp>.)
</p>
<span id="index-dir_002c-_007e_002f_002ehyperb"></span>
<span id="index-hbmap_003adir_002duser"></span>
<span id="index-global-button-2"></span>
<p>A personal button file may serve as a user&rsquo;s own roadmap to frequently
used resources, like a personal home page.  Selection of the
ButFile/PersonalFile menu item, <kbd>{C-h h b p}</kbd>, displays this file for
editing.  The default personal button file is stored within the
directory given by the <code>hbmap:dir-user</code> variable whose standard
value is <samp>~/.hyperb</samp>.  The default Hyperbole configuration also
appends all global buttons to the end of this file, one per line, as
they are created.  So you can edit or annotate them within the file.
</p>
<p>A directory-specific button file may exist for each file system
directory.  Such files are useful for explaining the contents of
directories and pointing readers to particular highlights within the
directories.  Selection of the ButFile/DirFile menu item, <kbd>{C-h h
b d}</kbd>, displays the button file for the current directory; this
provides an easy means of updating this file when working on a file
within the same directory.  If you want to view some other
directory-specific button file, simply use the normal Emacs file
finding commands.
</p>
<p>If you want group and site-specific button files, simply place links
to such files at the top of your personal button file and do so for
your colleagues.  This provides a flexible means of connecting to
such resources.

<span id="index-argument_002c-use"></span>
<span id="index-action"></span>
<span id="index-button-action"></span>
<p><em>Action types</em> are Emacs Lisp commands that specify Hyperbole
button behaviors.  Hyperbole includes a useful set of action types
defined within their own namespace and created with the <code>defact</code>
macro.  See the Hyperbole file, <samp>hactypes.el</samp>, for examples of
how to define your own Hyperbole action types.
</p>
<p>Each action type may be used by any category of button: global,
explicit, or implicit.  The arguments needed by an action type are
prompted for at button creation time or in the case of an implicit
button, computed when the button is activated.  During button
activation, the arguments are fed to the action type&rsquo;s body to achieve
the desired result.  This body is called the button <em>action</em>.
</p>
<p>Hyperbole handles all of this processing transparently.  As a user, all
you need know is the set of action types that you can work with when
creating explicit or global buttons.

<p>Action types create a convenient way of specifying button behavior
without the need to know how to program.  Expert users who are familiar
with Emacs Lisp, however, may find that they often want to tailor button
actions in a variety of ways not easily captured within a type system.
In such cases, <code>hui:ebut-prompt-for-action</code> should be set to
&lsquo;<samp>t</samp>&rsquo;.  This will cause Hyperbole to prompt for an action to override
the button&rsquo;s action type at each explicit button creation.  For those cases
where the action type is sufficient, a &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo; value should be
entered for the action.  An action may be any Lisp form that Emacs
Lisp can evaluate.

<span id="index-button-precedence"></span>
<span id="index-precedence_002c-buttons"></span>
<span id="index-button-label-overlap"></span>
<p>Explicit buttons always take precedence over implicit buttons.  Thus, if
a button selection is made which falls within both an explicit and
implicit button, only the explicit button will be selected.  Explicit
button labels are not allowed to overlap; Hyperbole&rsquo;s behavior in such
cases is undefined.
</p>
<span id="index-ibtype-priority"></span>
<p>If there is no explicit button at point during a selection request,
then each implicit button type predicate is tested in turn until one
returns non-nil or all are exhausted.  Since two implicit button types
may have overlapping <em>domains</em>, those contexts in which their
predicates are true, only the first matching type is used.  The type
predicates are tested in <em>reverse</em> order of definition, i.e.
most recently entered types are tested first, so that personal types
defined after standard system types take precedence.  It is important
to keep this order in mind when defining new implicit button types.
By making match predicates as specific as possible, one can minimize
any overlapping implicit button domains.
</p>
<span id="index-type-redefinition"></span>
<p>Once a type name is defined, its precedence relative to other types
remains the same even if its body is redefined, as long as its name is
not changed.  This allows incremental modifications to types without
any worry of altering their precedences.  See <a href="#Creating-Types">Creating Types</a>, for
information on how to develop or modify types.

<p>Creating explicit buttons is fun and easy.  You can always try them out
immediately after creating them or can utilize the Assist Key to verify
what buttons do.
</p>
<p>If you want to create an explicit link button to somewhere within an
Emacs window, then simply drag with the Assist Mouse Key from an
editable buffer (outside of a draggable item) to the target buffer.
Note, the same Action Mouse Key drag creates an implicit button
instead.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, the Hyperbole minibuffer menu item, Ebut/Create, will
create any type of explicit button, but requires a few steps.
</p>
<p>The next two subsections examine explicit button creation and
modification in detail.

<span id="index-C_002dh-h-e-e"></span>
<p>Explicit buttons are managed with the Hyperbole Ebut/ menu accessed with
<kbd>{C-h h e}</kbd>.  The Create item, <kbd>{C-h h e c}</kbd>, creates any type of
explicit button.  It prompts for an explicit button label (default is any
selected region), an action type, and the action&rsquo;s associated arguments.
It then creates the button at point and surrounds the label with
&lt;(explicit button delimiters)&gt; like so, to indicate success.
</p>
<p>You can use the direct selection techniques mentioned in <a href="#Smart-Key-Argument-Selection">Smart Key Argument Selection</a>, to select any completion-based arguments.  If you do
not mark a region before invoking the button create command, you will be
prompted for both a label and a target buffer for the button and the
delimited label text will be inserted into the target buffer after a
successful button creation.
</p>
<span id="index-button-instance"></span>
<span id="index-instance-number"></span>
<p>If a previous button with the same label exists in the same buffer,
Hyperbole will add an <em>instance number</em> to the label when it adds
the delimiters so that the name is unique.  Thus, you don&rsquo;t have to
worry about accidental button name conflicts.  If you want the same
button to appear in multiple places within the buffer, just enter the
label again and delimit it yourself or copy and paste the button with
its delimiters.  Hyperbole will interpret all occurrences of the same
delimited label within a buffer as the same button.

<p>If you have exactly two Emacs windows in your current frame or exactly
two windows visible across two Emacs frames, you can quickly create
explicit link buttons from your current point (source) to the point in
the other window (referent).  Simply use the Link menu item, <kbd>{C-h h
e l}</kbd>, to create a new explicit link button or to rename the one at point.
Hyperbole will either use the selected region as the new button label or
will prompt you for it.  It will then automatically choose the link type
based on the referent location and will either update the button at point
or create a new one.
</p>
<p>With more than two windows on screen, Hyperbole will prompt you to choose
the referent window and its associated point to which to link.  If the
Ace Window package is installed and active, this will be used to choose
the window via keyboard; otherwise, you will be prompted to select
it by mouse.

<p>Alternatively, to create an explicit link button to a referent
displayed within an Emacs window, simply drag with the Assist (not the
Action) Mouse Key depressed from an editable source window to another
window with the desired link referent and then release.  The drag must
start outside of a draggable item, see <a href="#Displaying-Items">Displaying Items</a>.
Hyperbole will either automatically select the button type based on
the referent context or will prompt you to select from one of a few
possible link types.
</p>
<p>In detail, you should split your current Emacs frame into two
windows: one which contains the point at which you want a button to be
inserted and another which shows the point to which you want to link.
Depress the Assist Mouse Key at the source point for the button (anywhere
but on a paired delimiter such as double quotes or parentheses).  Then
drag to the other window and release the Assist Mouse Key at the start
point of the link referent.  The process becomes quite simple with a
little practice. (See <a href="#By-Menu">Creation Via Menus</a>, for a more detailed
explanation of the explicit button creation process).
</p>
<p>If a region was selected prior to the start of the drag, it is used as
the button label; otherwise, you are prompted for the label.
Hyperbole uses the link referent context to determine the type of link
to make.  If there are a few different types of links which are
applicable from the context, you will be prompted with a list of the
types.  Simply use the Action Key or the first capital letter of the
link type to select one of the type names to finish the link
creation.  Hyperbole will then insert explicit button delimiters
around the button label and will display a message in the minibuffer
indicating the button label, its action/link type, and any arguments,
notably the thing to which it links.
</p>
<p>The following table shows the type of link that will be created based
upon the referent context in which the Action Key is released.

<p>Once an explicit button has been created, its label text must be
treated specially.  Any inter-word spacing within the label may be
freely changed, as may happen when a paragraph is refilled, but a
special command must be invoked to rename it.
</p>
<p>The rename command operates in two different ways.  If point is within
a button label when it is invoked, it will tell you to edit the button
label and then to invoke the rename command again after the edit.  The
second invocation will actually rename the button.  If instead the
command is originally invoked outside of any explicit button, it will
prompt for the button label to replace and the label to replace it
with and then will perform the renaming.  All occurrences of the same
button in the buffer will be renamed.
</p>

<span id="index-file_002c-hyperbole_002eel"></span>
<span id="index-hui_003aebut_002drename"></span>
<p>The rename command may be invoked from the Hyperbole menu via
Ebut/Rename.  Hyperbole does not bind this command to a key by default.
<kbd>{C-h w hui:ebut-rename <span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> will show what if any key is bound
within your Emacs.  Bind it within your <samp>~/.emacs</samp> file with:
<code>(hkey-set-key &quot;\C-cr&quot; 'hui:ebut-rename)</code>, for example.

<p>Ebut/Delete works similarly to the Rename command but deletes the
selected button.  The button&rsquo;s delimiters are removed to confirm the
deletion.  If the delete command is invoked with a prefix argument, then
both the button label and the delimiters are removed as confirmation.
</p>
<span id="index-hui_003ahbut_002ddelete_002dconfirm_002dflag"></span>
<p>Presently there is no way to recover a deleted button; it must
be recreated.  Therefore, the <code>hui:hbut-delete-confirm-flag</code> variable
is true by default, causing Hyperbole to require confirmation before
interactively deleting explicit buttons.  Set it to &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo; if you
prefer no confirmation.

<p>There is a quicker way to edit explicit link buttons, however.  Simply
drag with the Action Mouse Key from within the button label to a link

</p>
<p>Ebut/Help/BufferButs summarizes the explicit buttons in the order in
which they appear in the buffer.  Ebut/Help/CurrentBut summarizes only
the button at point.  Ebut/Help/OrderedButs summarizes the buttons in

<p>Ebut/Search prompts for a search pattern and searches across all the

asks you whether to match to any part of a button label or to whole
labels only.  It then displays a list of button matches with a single
line of surrounding context from their sources.  Any button in the match
list may be activated as usual.  An Action Key press on the surrounding
context jumps to the associated source line.  A press on the filename
preceding the matches jumps to the file without selecting a particular
line.

<span id="index-menu-item_002c-Cust_002fMsg_002dToggle_002dEbuts"></span>
<p>Hyperbole supports embedding buttons within electronic mail messages
composed in Emacs.  An enhanced mail reader may then be used to
activate the buttons within messages just like any other buttons.
Because this involves complex changes to mail support functions, this
feature is disabled by default.  Use the Cust/Msg-Toggle-Ebuts
minibuffer menu item to enable it.

<p>Hyperbole supports the following mail readers: Rmail (see <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Rmail">Reading
Mail with Rmail</a> in <cite>the GNU Emacs Manual</cite>), VM (see <a data-manual="vm" href="vm.html#Introduction">Introduction</a> in <cite>the VM Manual</cite>) and MH-e.  Button inclusion and activation within USENET news
articles is also supported in the same fashion via the Gnus news reader if
available at your site (see <a data-manual="gnus" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/gnus.html#Top">The Gnus Newsreader</a> in <cite>the Gnus
Manual</cite>).  (The <samp>hmail.el</samp> file defines a generalized interface that can
be used to hook in other mail or news readers if the necessary interface
functions are written.)
</p>
<span id="index-mail_002dyank_002doriginal"></span>
<span id="index-C_002dc-C_002dy"></span>
<span id="index-mail-inclusion"></span>
<p>All explicit buttons to be mailed must be created within the outgoing
message buffer. There is no present support for including text from
other buffers or files which contain explicit buttons, except for the
ability to yank the contents of a message being replied to, together
with all of its buttons, via the <code>(mail-yank-original)</code> command
bound to <kbd>{C-c C-y}</kbd>.  From a user&rsquo;s perspective, buttons are
created in precisely the same way as in any other buffer.  They also
appear just like any other buttons to both the message sender and the
reader who uses the Hyperbole enhanced readers.  Button operation may be
tested any time before a message is sent.  A person who does not use
Hyperbole enhanced mail readers can still send messages with embedded
buttons since mail composing is independent of any mail reader
choice.
</p>
<p>Hyperbole buttons embedded within received mail messages behave as do
any other buttons.  The mail does not contain any of the action type
definitions used by the buttons, so the receiver must have these or
she will receive an error when she activates the buttons.  Buttons
which appear in message <em>Subject</em> lines are copied to summary
buffers whenever such summaries are generated.  Thus, they may be
activated from either the message or the summary buffers.
</p>
<p>Nothing bad will happen if a mail message with explicit buttons is sent
to a non-Hyperbole user.  The user will simply see the text
of the message followed by a series of lines of button data at its end.
Hyperbole mail users never see this data in its raw form.
</p>
<span id="index-smail_003acomment"></span>
<span id="index-mail-comment"></span>
<span id="index-Hyperbole-mail-comment"></span>
<p>In order to alert readers of your mail messages that you can handle
Hyperbole mail buttons, you can set the variable, <code>smail:comment</code>,
to an expression that automatically inserts a comment into each
outgoing message to announce this fact.  See its documentation for
technical details.  By default, no comment is added.  To have a
comment line added to your outgoing message, add the following to
to your <samp>~/.emacs</samp> file before the point at which you load
Hyperbole.
</p>
<div class="example lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(setq smail:comment
 (format &quot;Comments: GNU Hyperbole mail buttons accepted, v%s.\n&quot;
          hyperb:version))
</pre></div>

<p>This will produce the following line in outgoing messages:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">Comments: GNU Hyperbole mail buttons accepted, vX.X.X.
</pre></div>

<span id="index-file_002c-_002eemacs-2"></span>
<p>where the X&rsquo;s indicate your Hyperbole version number.  You can cut
this out of particular messages before you send them when need be.
</p>
<span id="index-actype_002c-link_002dto_002dmail"></span>
<p>A final mail-related facility provided by Hyperbole is the ability to
save a pointer to a received mail message by creating an explicit button
with a <code>link-to-mail</code> action type.  When prompted for the mail
message to link to, if you press the Action Key within the message, the
appropriate link parameters will be copied to the argument prompt, as
described in <a href="#Smart-Key-Argument-Selection">Smart Key Argument Selection</a>.

<p>Explicit buttons may be embedded within outgoing USENET news articles
and may be activated from within the Gnus news reader.  Because this
involves complex changes to news support functions, this feature is
disabled by default.  Use the Cust/Msg-Toggle-Ebuts minibuffer menu
item to enable it (enabling it for mail also enables it for news and
vice versa).
</p>
<p>Once enabled, all Hyperbole support should work just as it does when
reading or sending mail.  See <a href="#Buttons-in-Mail">Buttons in Mail</a>.  When reading news,
buttons which appear in message <em>Subject</em> lines may be activated
within the Gnus subject buffer as well as the article buffer.  When
posting news, the *post-news* buffer is used for outgoing news
articles rather than a mail-related buffer.
</p>
<p>Remember that the articles you post do not contain the action type
definitions used by the buttons, so the receiver must have these or she
will receive an error when she activates the buttons.  You should also
keep in mind that most USENET readers will not be using Hyperbole, so if
they receive a news article containing explicit buttons, they will
wonder what the button data at the end of the message is.  You should
therefore limit distribution of such messages.  For example, if most
people at your site read news with Gnus and use Hyperbole, it would be
reasonable to embed buttons in postings to local newsgroups.
</p>
<span id="index-news-comment"></span>
<p>In order to alert readers of your postings that they may send you
personal replies with embedded Hyperbole buttons, the system inserts
into news postings the same comment that is included within mail
messages, if enabled.  See <a href="#Buttons-in-Mail">Buttons in Mail</a>, for details and an
explanation of how to turn this feature on.

<p>Pulldown and popup menus are available to invoke Hyperbole commands,
including those from the HyRolo and the Koutliner.  These menus operate
like any other application menus and are fairly self-explanatory.  Use
the <code>Remove-This-Menu</code> command on the Hyperbole menubar menu to
get rid of the menu if you do not need it.  Invoking Hyperbole from
the keyboard, as explained below, will add the menu back to the
menubar.  Here is the Hyperbole Menubar Menu and its Find submenu.

<p>The Hyperbole popup menu, <code>hyperbole-popup-menu</code>, replicates the
Hyperbole menubar menu.  It can be bound to a mouse key but is not
bound to one by default.   It can also be assigned as the default
Action or Assist Key action to use when no matching context is found.

with the keyboard, they provide command access similar to key
bindings.  In fact, any menu item can be bound to a global key
sequence.  See <a href="#Binding-Minibuffer-Menu-Items">Binding Minibuffer Menu Items</a>.

<p>You can reload the Hyperbole minibuffer menus and Smart Key handlers
to reflect any recent edits when on the top-level Hyperbole menu by
pressing <kbd>{<span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> or the Action Key on the menu name (first
item that ends with &rsquo;&gt;&rsquo;).  This will also quit from the menu.
</p>
<p>You can quit from the minibuffer menus without selecting an item by
using <kbd>{Q}</kbd>, or by pressing <kbd>{<span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> or <kbd>{M-<span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd>
when at the end of a menu.  <kbd>{C-g}</kbd> aborts from the minibuffer
whether you are at a menu prompt or any other Hyperbole prompt.
<kbd>{X}</kbd> both quits the menus and disables the Hyperbole global minor
mode; <kbd>{C-h h}</kbd> restores the menus and re-enables Hyperbole minor
mode.

                   If in an Emacs Lisp mode buffer and no PREFIX-ARG
                   is given, limit search to only .el and .el.gz

                   matching pathnames found throughout the file
                   system.  On Mac OS X, this uses Spotlight
                   (the <code>mdfind</code> command); on UNIX, it uses
                   the <code>locate</code> command.  Within the resulting
                   *Locate* buffer, Find/Grep-Files will find matching lines

<p>HyWiki is Hyperbole&rsquo;s markup-free, personal Wiki system for
note-taking and automatic HyWikiWord highlighting and hyperlinking.
It uses Org mode for note taking and adds automatic hyperlinking and
highlighting of HyWikiWords in Org files within
<code>hywiki-directory</code> (default = <samp>~/hywiki</samp>).  With <kbd>{C-h h
h p}</kbd> you can publish any updated part of your HyWiki to an HTML
directory for export to the web.

<span id="HyWikiWords-1"></span><h3 class="section">6.1 HyWikiWords</h3>

<span id="index-HyWikiWord"></span>
<span id="index-WikiWord"></span>
<span id="index-HyWiki-Org-link-format"></span>
<span id="index-Org-link_002c-HyWiki"></span>
<span id="index-hy_003a-prefix"></span>
<p>A <em>HyWikiWord</em> is a capitalized word that contains upper and
lowercase letters only and has a corresponding <samp>HyWikiWord.org</samp>
wiki page file below <code>hywiki-directory</code>.  HyWikiWords in HyWiki
pages are automatically highlighted and turned into hyperlinks as soon
as you type them, without the need for any delimiters.  However, if
you prefer to use Org-style links, simply delimit them with double
square brackets and the &lsquo;hy:&rsquo; prefix like so: [[hy:MyWikiWord]].
</p>
<span id="index-create-a-HyWikiWord"></span>
<span id="index-HyWikiWord-create"></span>
<p>To create a new HyWikiWord, insert it into a text buffer, move point
onto the word and press <kbd>{C-h h h c}</kbd> to create a new blank HyWiki
page that you can immediately start editing.  HyWiki is built for
scalability and has been tested to be performant with 10,000
HyWikiWords.
</p>
<span id="index-Org-M_002dRET-override-1"></span>

<span id="index-menu-item_002c-HyWiki_002fOrg_002dM_002dRET_002fAll_002dHyperbole_002dContexts"></span>
<p>The Action Key can create new HyWiki pages when on an undefined
HyWikiWord if you change the setting that controls the Org mode
<kbd>{M-<span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> binding.  Have Hyperbole override Org&rsquo;s control of
that key in all Action and Assist Key contexts with the
&lsquo;<samp>All-Hyperbole-Contexts</samp>&rsquo; setting bound to <kbd>{C-h h h o a}</kbd>.
</p>
<span id="index-activate-HyWiki-link"></span>
<span id="index-link_002c-HyWikiWord"></span>
<span id="index-C_002dh-h-h-a"></span>

<span id="index-menu-item_002c-HyWiki_002fOrg_002dM_002dRET_002fNone"></span>
<p>To jump to a HyWiki page, simply move point onto any highlighted
HyWikiWord and press the Action Key <kbd>{M-<span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd>.  This also
highlights any other instances of HyWikiWords across all visible Emacs
windows.  If you have set the Org <kbd>{M-<span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> option to
&lsquo;<samp>None</samp>&rsquo; with <kbd>{C-h h h o i}</kbd>, then you will have to
use the HyWiki Act menu command <kbd>{C-h h h a}</kbd> instead to jump to HyWiki
pages.
</p>
<span id="index-HyWiki-section-link"></span>
<span id="index-link_002c-HyWiki-section"></span>
<p>HyWikiWord links can also jump to a section headline within a page by
following the page name with a &rsquo;#&rsquo; character and then the full section
headline name (sans any leading asterisks).  For example, if your
Emacs page has a &quot;Major Modes&quot; section, then either Emacs#Major-Modes
or [[hy:Emacs#Major Modes]] will work as a link to that section.  Note
that without the square bracket delimiters, you must convert spaces in
section names to &rsquo;-&rsquo; characters.  As long as the page exists, section
links are highlighted regardless of whether associated sections exist
or not.  When activating a link with a section reference, you will get
an error if the section does not exist.
</p>
<span id="index-HyWikiWord_002c-outside-the-wiki"></span>
<span id="index-hywiki_002dmode-1"></span>
<span id="index-toggle-hywiki_002dmode"></span>
<span id="index-hywiki_002dmode-3"></span>
<span id="index-C_002dh-h-h-t"></span>
<p>HyWikiWords can also be highlighted and treated as hyperlinks in
non-special text and programming buffers outside of the
<code>hywiki-directory</code> when the global minor mode, <code>hywiki-mode</code>
is enabled.  Toggle it via <kbd>{C-h h h t}</kbd> or <kbd>{M-x hywiki-mode
<span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd>.
</p>
<span id="index-hywiki_002dorg_002dlink_002dtype_002drequired"></span>
<span id="index-hsys_002dorg_002denable_002dsmart_002dkeys-2"></span>
<span id="index-override-Org-M_002dRET-2"></span>
<span id="index-HyWiki-Action-Key"></span>
<span id="index-Action-Key_002c-HyWiki"></span>
<p>If you prefer Org-style links in buffers outside of
<code>hywiki-directory</code>, use the &rsquo;hy:&rsquo; prefix, as in:
[[hy:MyWikiWord]].  If you set <code>hywiki-org-link-type-required</code> to
&lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo;, then you don&rsquo;t need the prefix, e.g. [[MyWikiWord]];
existing HyWiki page names then will override Org&rsquo;s standard handling
of such links.  To prevent Org mode&rsquo;s binding of <kbd>{M-<span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd>
from splitting lines and creating new headlines when on a HyWikiWord
whose page has not yet been created, set
<code>hsys-org-enable-smart-keys</code> to &lsquo;<samp>t</samp>&rsquo; so that Hyperbole&rsquo;s
Action Key does the right thing in this context.
</p>
<span id="index-HyWikiWord-contexts"></span>
<p>Once Hyperbole has been loaded and activated, HyWikiWords (with or
without delimiters) are automatically highlighted and active in
the following contexts:
</p>
<ul>
<li> HyWiki page buffers;
</li><li> non-special text buffers, after &lsquo;hywiki-mode&rsquo; is enabled;
</li><li> comments of programming buffers, after &lsquo;hywiki-mode&rsquo; is enabled.
</li></ul>

<span id="index-HyWikiWord-highlighting"></span>
<p>As HyWikiWords are typed, highlighting occurs after a trailing
whitespace or punctuation character is added, or when the HyWikiWord
is surrounded by a matching pair of characters such as curly braces or
single square brackets.  Since Org links use double square brackets
and Org targets use double or triple angle brackets, HyWikiWords
within these delimiters are ignored once the brackets are in place.
</p>
<span id="index-hywiki_002dword_002dhighlight_002dflag"></span>
<p>The custom setting, <code>hywiki-word-highlight-flag</code> (default =
&lsquo;<samp>t</samp>&rsquo;), means HyWikiWords will be auto-highlighted within HyWiki
pages.  Outside of such pages, <code>hywiki-mode</code> must also be enabled
for such auto-highlighting.
</p>
<span id="index-hywiki_002dexclude_002dmajor_002dmodes"></span>
<span id="index-HyWiki-exclude-modes"></span>
<p>The custom setting, <code>hywiki-exclude-major-modes</code> (default =
&lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo;), is a list of major modes to exclude from HyWikiWord
auto-highlighting and recognition.
</p>
<span id="index-HyWiki-programming-modes"></span>
<span id="index-hywiki_002dhighlight_002dall_002din_002dprog_002dmodes"></span>
<p>Within programming modes, HyWikiWords are highlighted and hyperlinked
within comments only.  For programming modes in which you want
HyWikiWords recognized everywhere, add them to the custom setting,
<code>hywiki-highlight-all-in-prog-modes</code> (default =
<code>'(lisp-interaction-mode)</code>).
</p>
<span id="index-ibtypes-hywiki_002dword-1"></span>
<span id="index-ibtype-hywiki_002dword"></span>
<p>HyWiki adds one implicit button type to Hyperbole: <code>hywiki-word</code>,
which creates and displays HyWikiWord pages.  This is one of the lowest
priority implicit button types so that it triggers only when other
types are not recognized first.

<p>HyNote is a start on Hyperbole&rsquo;s note taking system.  HyNote supports
Org, Markdown, Koutline and Emacs Outline file formats.
</p>
<span id="index-hynote_002ddirectory_002dlist"></span>
<span id="index-ibtypes-hynote_002dfile-1"></span>
<span id="index-ibtype-hynote_002dfile"></span>
<p>Presently HyNote simply provides an experience similar to the HyWiki
for Org and Org Roam file name stems and headline links for files
found in the directories of <code>hynote-directory-list</code>, which
defaults to the default Org and Org Roam directories.  For example, if
the file <samp>~/Org/hyperbole-cmds.org</samp> has a headline,
&lsquo;<samp>hyrolo-fgrep Command</samp>&rsquo;, then &quot;hyperbole-cmds#hyrolo-fgrep Command&quot;
in any file will link to that headline.  See the documentation for the
implicit button type that HyNote defines, <code>hynote-file</code>.
</p>
<p>In the future, HyNote will also provide a universal way to easily link to
information across many file formats.

<p>Hyperbole includes the fastest, easiest-to-use Emacs window and frame
management system available, HyControl, found under the Hyperbole
Screen menu.  If you use a lot of Emacs windows or frames (typically,
window system windows) then this chapter is for you.
</p>
<p>HyControl interactively adjusts the layout of your windows and frames
down to the pixel-level if desired.  You adjust the location, size and
display elements of your windows and frames until they look as you like
and then simply quit HyControl and go back to work.
</p>
<span id="index-C_002dc-_005c"></span>

<span id="index-menu-item_002c-WindowsControl"></span>
<span id="index-menu-item_002c-FramesControl"></span>
<p>Hyperbole binds the key <kbd>{C-c \}</kbd> for quick access to HyControl&rsquo;s
window control menu, if it was not already bound prior to Hyperbole&rsquo;s
initialization; otherwise, the Screen/WindowsControl minibuffer menu
item, <kbd>{C-h h s w}</kbd>, will do the same thing.  To start HyControl
with the frames menu instead, use Screen/FramesControl, <kbd>{C-h h s
f}</kbd>.
</p>
<span id="index-submodes"></span>
<span id="index-screen_002c-t"></span>
<span id="index-screen_002c-q"></span>
<span id="index-screen_002c-Q"></span>
<p>Once in HyControl, your minibuffer window at the bottom of the
selected frame will display a summary of keys you may use to adjust
your windows until you press <kbd>{q}</kbd> or <kbd>{Q}</kbd> to quit from
HyControl.  The key, <kbd>{t}</kbd>, will always toggle between controlling
frames and windows, the <em>submodes</em> of HyControl, with the upper
left of the minibuffer prompt showing which type of control is active.
</p>
<span id="index-numeric-argument"></span>
<span id="index-multiplier"></span>
<p>A number of commands take a single numeric argument, e.g. movement and
sizing, which you can enter by typing a period to clear the argument,
followed by any positive number up to 1000.  You may also use
the <kbd>{C-u}</kbd> universal argument key to apply a multiplier of 4 to
the argument, any number of times.  Any entry that pushes the argument
over 1000, restarts it, so 10005 would produce an argument of 5.
</p>
<p>The table below explains what each key does in HyControl mode.  If the
explanation does not say otherwise, then the key applies in both window
and frame submodes.

<p>Display a <em>grid of windows</em> in the selected frame sized according to
the prefix argument or via a prompted input.  Left digit of the argument is
the number of grid rows and the right digit is the number of grid columns
to display.  The buffers displayed in the grid are determined by the value
of the prefix argument given to the command or by the selected items in the
current window if in Buffer Menu, Ibuffer Menu or Dired mode.
</p>
<span id="index-hycontrol_002ddisplay_002dbuffer_002dpredicate_002dlist"></span>
<p>With no prefix argument and no items chosen, the selected frame&rsquo;s buffer list
is filtered through <code>hycontrol-display-buffer-predicate-list</code>, a list of
predicate/boolean filter functions.  The default predicate selects existing
buffers with attached files and displays those.

<p>With a prefix argument of 0, the user is prompted for a major mode name and
the windows grid size.  Only those buffers with the named major mode are
displayed.
</p>
<p>With a prefix argument &lt; 0, the user is prompted for a shell glob-type file
pattern; matching files are read into buffers and displayed in an auto-sized
windows grid.
</p>
<p>Otherwise, when the prefix argument is an invalid size, the windows grid
command prompts for the grid size.
</p>
<p>When done, this resets the persistent prefix argument to 1 to prevent
following commands from using the often large grid size argument.
</p>





<span id="index-hycontrol_002dwindow_002dgrid_002drepeatedly"></span>
<p>If you ever need to experiment with different sized window grids, use
<kbd>{M-x hycontrol-window-grid-repeatedly <span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd>.  It will
repeatedly prompt you for a grid size and then display it.  When you
are done, simply press <kbd>{<span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> to exit.

<p>Programmatically, there are a number of ways to generate and display a windows grid.
<code>hycontrol-windows-grid-by-file-pattern</code> creates a windows grid from a glob file
pattern.  It is bound to <kbd>{C--1 C-c @}</kbd>.  <code>hycontrol-windows-grid-by-buffer-list</code>
creates a windows grid from a list of buffers or buffer names.
<code>hycontrol-windows-grid-by-file-list</code> creates a windows grid from a list of file

<br>
<p>The rest of this section goes into some technicalities about HyControl
settings.  You may ignore it if you are not familiar with Emacs
variables and functions or with customized Emacs.
</p>
<span id="index-HyControl-edge-placement"></span>
<span id="index-HyControl-corner-placement"></span>
<p>HyControl allows placement of frames at screen edges and corners with the
frame cycle command, <kbd>{c}</kbd>, and direct placement using the layout of the
numeric keypad keys, if available, or the <kbd>p</kbd> virtual keypad key
otherwise.  (Note that a screen may span multiple physical monitors).
</p>
<span id="index-HyControl-screen-edge-offsets"></span>
<span id="index-screen_002c-edge-offsets"></span>
<span id="index-hycontrol_002dscreen_002doffset_002dalist"></span>
<span id="index-hycontrol_002dset_002dscreen_002doffsets"></span>
<span id="index-hycontrol_002dget_002dscreen_002doffsets"></span>
<p>To prevent widgets and toolbars at the corners of the screen from
being obscured, HyControl can offset each frame from each screen edge
by a fixed number of pixels.  These offsets are specified by the
variable,<code>hycontrol-screen-offset-alist</code> and can differ for each type of
screen; see its documentation for details.  If you change its value,
then call <code>hycontrol-set-screen-offsets</code> to set any new offset
values.  <code>hycontrol-get-screen-offsets</code> returns the list of offsets
in clockwise order starting from the top edge.  Both functions display a
minibuffer message with the current offsets when called interactively.
</p>
<span id="index-hycontrol_002dframe_002doffset-1"></span>
<span id="index-frame_002c-make"></span>
<span id="index-make-frame"></span>
<p>When HyControl creates a new frame, it automatically sizes it to the
same size as the previously selected frame and offsets it from that
frame by the (X . Y) number of pixels given in the variable,
<code>hycontrol-frame-offset</code>.
</p>
<span id="index-file_002c-hycontrol_002eel"></span>
<span id="index-hycontrol_002denable_002dframes_002dmode"></span>
<span id="index-hycontrol_002denable_002d_002dwindows_002dmode"></span>
<p>The source code for the HyControl system is in <samp>hycontrol.el</samp>
within your Hyperbole source directory, given by <code>hyperb:dir</code>.
HyControl uses standard Emacs keymaps, so any keys can be rebound.
Remember that Hyperbole typically binds <kbd>{C-c \}</kbd> to the windows
control menu, but if you would like to bind either of the two
HyControl minor mode invocation commands to keys, they are,
<code>hycontrol-enable-windows-mode</code> and <code>hycontrol-enable-frames-mode</code>.
Generally, you need only one of these bound to a key since when you
press that key, the other command can be reached by pressing <kbd>{t}</kbd>.

<p>The Hyperbole outliner, the Koutliner (pronounced Kay-outliner),
produces structured, autonumbered documents composed of hierarchies of
cells.  Each <em>cell</em> has two identifiers, a
<em>relative identifier</em> indicating its present position within the
outline and a <em>permanent identifier</em> called an <em>idstamp</em>,
suitable for use within hyperlink references to the cell.  The idstamp
is typically not displayed but is available when needed.
See <a href="#Autonumbering">Autonumbering</a>.
</p>
<p>Cells also store their time of creation and the user who created the
cell.  User-defined attributes may also be added to cells.  See <a href="#Cell-Attributes">Cell Attributes</a>.

that explains major outliner operations.  You can test out the viewing,
editing and motion commands with this file since a personal copy is made
when you invoke this command.  If you have already edited this file and
want to start with a fresh one, give the command a prefix argument:
<kbd>{C-u C-h h k e}</kbd>.

<p>In addition to the Kotl/Create menu item, you can create and experiment
with outline files simply by finding a file, <kbd>{C-x C-f}</kbd>, with a

<span id="index-cell_002c-idstamp-0"></span>
<p>When a new koutline is created, an invisible root cell is added.  Its
permanent and relative ids are both 0, and it is considered to be at
level 0 in the outline.  All visible cells in the outline are at level 1
or deeper, and thus are descendants of this root cell.  Some koutliner
commands prompt for cell numbers as arguments.  An argument of 0 makes
commands operate upon the entire outline.
</p>
<p>An initial level 1 cell is also created to make it easy to start
entering text in the outline.  A koutline always has at least one
visible cell in it.
</p>
<p>See <a href="#Autonumbering">Autonumbering</a>, which explains how cells are labeled according to their
respective levels in the outline and how these labels are updated as the
structure of the outline changes.

<span id="index-autonumber-1"></span>
<span id="index-relative-identifier"></span>
<p>See <a href="#Adding-and-Killing">Adding and Killing</a>, for information on how to add new cells to or
remove cells from a koutline.  As you do this, or as you promote or
demote cells within the outline, the labels preceding the contents of
each cell automatically update to reflect the new structure.  These
labels are also known as <em>autonumbers</em> and as <em>relative ids</em>
because they change as the structure changes.
</p>
<span id="index-outline-structure"></span>
<p>The outline structure is shown by these labels and by the indentation of
each outline level.  Normally, each deeper level is indented another
three characters, to reflect the nesting.
</p>
<span id="index-label-type_002c-alpha"></span>
<span id="index-label-type_002c-legal"></span>
<span id="index-alpha-labels"></span>
<span id="index-legal-labels"></span>
<span id="index-outline_002c-label-type"></span>
<p>The default autonumbers are called <em>alphanumeric labels</em> because
they alternate between using numbers and letters to distinguish each
successive level.  Each alphanumeric label uniquely identifies a cell&rsquo;s
position in an outline, so that there is no need to scan back to prior
cells to see what the current section number of an outline is.  This is
similar to a legal numbering scheme but without all the period
characters between level numbers.  As an example, 1b3 is equivalent to a
legal label of 1.2.3.  Both refer to the 3rd cell at level 3,
below the 2nd child of the first cell at level 1.  Said another way,
this is the 3rd child of the 1st cell&rsquo;s 2nd child.  In other words, it
is easier to visualize hierarchies than to talk about them.
</p>
<p>Alphanumeric labels are the default because they are shorter and easier
to read aloud than equivalent legal ones.  They also simplify
distinguishing between even and odd level labels because of the
alternating character set.
</p>
<span id="index-koutliner_002c-C_002dc-C_002dl"></span>
<span id="index-label-type_002c-changing"></span>
<p>You can change the labeling scheme used in a particular outline with
the command <kbd>{C-c C-l}</kbd>.  A <kbd>{?}</kbd> will show all of the
labeling options.  The default, alpha labels, legal labels, and
permanent idstamps (permanent cell ids) are all available.
</p>
<span id="index-label-separator_002c-changing"></span>
<span id="index-cell-label-separator"></span>
<span id="index-outline-label-separator"></span>
<span id="index-koutliner_002c-C_002dc-M_002dl"></span>
<span id="index-koutliner_002c-C_002du-C_002dc-M_002dl"></span>
<p>A cell label is normally followed by a period and a space, called the
<em>label separator</em>, prior to the start of the cell contents.  You can
change the separator for the current outline with <kbd>{C-c M-l}</kbd>.
<kbd>{C-u C-c M-l}</kbd> will additionally change the default separator
value used when new outlines are created (for the current session only).
For example, use the value &quot;  &quot; (two spaces) to get eliminate the
trailing period after each cell label.  The separator must be at least
two characters long but may be longer.
</p>
<span id="index-file_002c-_002eemacs-3"></span>
<span id="index-initialization-file"></span>
<p>If you find a separator that you prefer for all outlines, change the
separator setting permanently by adding the following line to your Emacs
initialization file, <samp>~/.emacs</samp>, substituting for &lsquo;your-separator&rsquo;:

<span id="index-permanent-identifier-1"></span>
<span id="index-idstamp-1"></span>
<p>Idstamps (permanent ids) are associated with each cell.  They maintain
hyperlinks as cells are reordered within a koutline.  See <a href="#Klinks">Klinks</a>.
Idstamps may be displayed in place of the outline level relative ids.
Use <kbd>{C-c C-l id <span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd>.
</p>
<span id="index-idstamp-counter"></span>
<p>An idstamp counter for each outline starts at 0 and is incremented by
one each time a cell is added to the outline.  This idstamp stays with
the cell no matter where it is moved within the outline.  If the cell is
deleted, its idstamp is not reused.

<span id="index-root-cell-1"></span>

<span id="index-cell_002c-idstamp-0-1"></span>
<span id="index-idstamp-0"></span>
<p>The 0 idstamp is always assigned to the root node of the entire outline.
This node is never visible within the outline, but is used so that the
outline may be treated as a single tree when needed.  Idstamps always
begin with a 0, as in 012, to distinguish them from relative ids.

<p>Text editing within the Koutliner works just as it does for other
buffers, except when you need to deal with the structural components of
an outline.  Within the contents of a cell, all of your standard editing
keys should work properly.  You can just type in text and the left and
right margins of the lines will be maintained for you.  See <a href="#Filling">Filling</a>,
for the times when you need to refill a paragraph or to control when
filling occurs.
</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t invoke editing commands with <kbd>{M-x command-name <span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd>
since the Koutliner uses differently named commands made to act
like the regular editing commands.  Koutliner commands, however, account
for the structure and indentation in koutlines.
</p>
<span id="index-cell-selection"></span>
<p>You may use the mouse to select parts of the contents of a single cell
for editing.  But don&rsquo;t drag across cell boundaries and then edit the
selected region, since that will destroy the outline structure.

<p><em>Demotion</em> is the act of moving a tree down one or more levels in the
outline.  The new tree will become either the successor or the first
child of the cell which precedes it in the outline.  <em>Promotion</em> is
the inverse operation.  Note that trees (cells and their entire
substructure) are promoted and demoted, not individual cells.

<p>Trees may be demoted or promoted by pressing <tt class="key">TAB</tt> or
<kbd>{M-<span class="key">TAB</span>}</kbd>.  <kbd>{M-0 <span class="key">TAB</span>}</kbd> and <kbd>{M-0 M-<span class="key">TAB</span>}</kbd>
demote and promote trees and additionally refill each cell that is not
specially marked to prevent refilling.  See <a href="#Filling">Filling</a>.  A positive or
negative prefix argument to these commands promotes or demotes the
tree up to a maximum of the number of levels given by the argument.
The outline may not support movement of the tree by the number of
levels requested, however, in which case the maximal possible
adjustment is made.

<p><kbd>{M-1 <span class="key">TAB</span>}</kbd> behaves specially.  It toggles the function of
<tt class="key">TAB</tt> and <kbd>{M-<span class="key">TAB</span>}</kbd> so that they insert a tab
and remove the previous character, respectively.  This is useful when
one is formatting information within a single cell.  When in this
mode, <kbd>{<span class="key">TAB</span>}</kbd> inserts a literal TAB character, by default.
Set the variable, <code>kotl-mode:indent-tabs-mode</code>, to
&lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo; if you want space characters used to form the tab.
Use <kbd>{M-1 <span class="key">TAB</span>}</kbd> to toggle the <tt class="key">TAB</tt> and
<kbd>{M-<span class="key">TAB</span>}</kbd> keys back to promoting and demoting trees.

<span id="index-Org-tables"></span>
<p>The Koutliner also supports Org Table editing, see <a data-manual="org" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/org.html#Tables">Tables</a> in <cite>the Org Mode Manual</cite>, via Org table minor mode.  Use <kbd>{M-x

off.

<span id="index-Action-Key_002c-cell-argument"></span>
<span id="index-koutliner_002c-Action-Key_002c-cell-argument"></span>
<p>Like Org mode, you can move the tree rooted at point past trees rooted
at the same level with <kbd>{M-&lt;down&gt;}</kbd> and before trees with
<kbd>{M-&lt;up&gt;}</kbd>.  Give a prefix argument to move past that many other
trees.  (A 0 valued argument is automatically changed to 1).
</p>
<p>For maximum flexibility in rearranging outlines, there are commands
that move or copy entire trees anywhere within the outline as
described in the table below.  Each of these commands prompts for the
label of the root cell to move or copy and for a second cell which
specifies the new location for the moved or copied tree.  You may
either accept the default provided, type in the cell label, or when a
mouse is available, simply double click with the Action Key on the
contents of a cell.  The Koutliner knows to use the cell&rsquo;s label in
such cases.
</p>
<p>In the following commands, words delimited with &lt;&gt; represent the
arguments for which each command prompts.  Note how the use of prefix
arguments changes each command&rsquo;s behavior from insertion at the sibling
level to insertion at the child level.

<p>If you have mouse support under Hyperbole, you can move entire trees
with mouse clicks.  Click the Assist Key within the indentation to the

click the Action Key within the contents of the root cell of the tree to
move and then double click within the root contents of the tree you want
it to follow as a successor.

<p>The Koutliner supports copying and moving within a single outline only
right now, so don&rsquo;t try to to move trees across different outline files.
You can, however, copy an outline tree to a non-outline buffer with:

<span id="index-insertion"></span>
<span id="index-koutliner_002c-C_002dx-i"></span>
<span id="index-outline_002c-foreign-file"></span>
<p>The paragraphs of another buffer or file may be inserted into a koutline
as a set of cells by using the <kbd>{C-x i}</kbd> command.  When prompted,
you may use a buffer name or filename from which to insert;
completion is provided for filenames only.
</p>
<span id="index-koutliner_002c-C_002du-C_002dx-i"></span>
<p>The elements from the original buffer are converted into kcells and
inserted as the successors of the current cell.  If <kbd>{C-u C-x i}</kbd>
is used, they are instead inserted as the initial children of the current
cell.
</p>
<span id="index-kimport_003amode_002dalist"></span>

<span id="index-file_002c-importing"></span>
<span id="index-importing-a-file"></span>
<span id="index-Koutline-import"></span>
<p>For information on mode and suffix-specific conversions performed on
file elements before they are inserted, see the documentation for the
variables, <code>kimport:mode-alist</code> and <code>kimport:suffix-alist</code>.  This
same conversion process applies if you invoke <kbd>{M-x kotl-mode
<span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> in a non-koutline buffer or if you perform a generic file import
as described later in this section.
</p>
<span id="index-kimport_003ainsert_002dfile_002dcontents"></span>
<p>Use <kbd>{M-x kimport:insert-file-contents <span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> to insert an
entire file into the current cell following point.
</p>
<span id="index-kimport_003afile"></span>
<span id="index-C_002dh-h-k-f-f"></span>
<p>The outliner supports conversion of three types of files into koutline
files.  You can import a file into an existing koutline,
following the tree at point, or can create a new koutline from the
imported file contents.  <kbd>{C-h h k f f}</kbd> or <kbd>{M-x kimport:file <span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd>
selects the importation type based on the buffer or filename suffix of the
file to import.
</p>
<span id="index-kotl_002dmode-1"></span>
<p>If you want to convert a buffer from some other mode into a koutline and
then want to save the converted buffer back to its original file,
thereby replacing the original format, use <kbd>{M-x kotl-mode <span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd>.
Remember that you will lose the old format of the buffer when you do
this.
</p>
<p>Use one of the following commands when you need explicit control over
the type of importation used on some text.  With these commands, your
original file remains intact.
</p>
<span id="index-kimport_003atext"></span>
<span id="index-text-file"></span>
<p>Use <kbd>{M-x kimport:text <span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> and you will be prompted for a text
buffer or file to import and the new koutline buffer or file to create
from its text.  Each paragraph will be imported as a separate cell, with
all imported cells at the same level, since indentation of paragraphs is
presently ignored.  This same command can be used to import the
contents, attributes and level structure of cells from another koutline.
</p>
<span id="index-kimport_003astar_002doutline"></span>
<span id="index-emacs-outline"></span>
<span id="index-star-outline"></span>
<p>Star outlines are standard emacs outlines where each entry begins with
one or more asterisk characters.  Use <kbd>{M-x kimport:star-outline
<span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> and you will be prompted for the star outline buffer or
file to import and the new koutline buffer or file to create.
</p>
<span id="index-Augment-outline"></span>
<span id="index-kimport_003aaug_002dpost_002doutline"></span>
<p>(Skip this if you are unfamiliar with the Augment/NLS system originally
created at SRI.)  Files exported from the Augment system as text often
have alphanumeric statement identifiers on the right side.  You can
import such files while maintaining their outline structure.  Use
<kbd>{M-x kimport:aug-post-outline <span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> and you will be
prompted for the Augment buffer or file to import and the koutline to
create.  See <a href="https://dougengelbart.org/content/view/148/">https://dougengelbart.org/content/view/148/</a> for more
information.

<p><kbd>{C-h h k f d}</kbd> or <kbd>{M-x kexport:display <span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> exports the
current Koutline buffer to a temporary HTML file and displays the file
in the web browser given by <code>browse-url-browser-function</code>.  Any tree
in the HTML outline may be expanded or collapsed by clicking the left
mouse button on its root cell, for ease of viewing.
</p>
<span id="index-kexport_003ahtml"></span>
<span id="index-C_002dh-h-k-f-h"></span>
<p>Alternatively, <kbd>{C-h h k f h}</kbd> or <kbd>{M-x kexport:html <span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd>
prompts for the koutline buffer or file to export, the HTML file or buffer
to which to output, and the title to use for the HTML file.  Completion of
filenames is provided.  The conversion will then be done and the output
file or buffer will be written; the output file will not be displayed.
You must display it manually, if desired.
</p>
<span id="index-kexport_003akoutline"></span>
<span id="index-C_002dh-h-k-f-k"></span>
<p><kbd>{C-h h k f k}</kbd> or <kbd>{M-x kexport:koutline <span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> exports the current
Koutline buffer to a <samp>.html</samp> file of the same name.  The output file will
not be displayed; you must display it manually, if desired.

<span id="index-expanding"></span>
<span id="index-hiding"></span>

<p>Individual cells, branches, or particular levels in the outline may be
hidden or shown.  These commands work even when an outline buffer is
read-only, e.g. when its file is not checked out of a version control
system yet, so that you can get effective views of an outline without
editing it.  Some of these commands affect the current view spec.
See <a href="#View-Specs">View Specs</a>.

<p><em>View specifications</em> (view specs, for short) are short codes used
to control the view of a koutline.  The view specs in effect for an
outline are always displayed in the modeline of the outline&rsquo;s window,
following the outline buffer name, unless the variable,
<code>kvspec:string</code>, has been set to &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo; to disable view spec
display.  The modeline display appears as &lt;|viewspec&gt; to aid rapid
visual location.  The | (pipe character) is also used in links that
specify view specs to indicate the start of a view spec sequence.
See <a href="#Klinks">Klinks</a>.
</p>
<span id="index-outline_002c-view-specs"></span>
<p>The current view spec is saved whenever the outline is saved.  The next
time the outline is read in, the same view spec will be applied.

<p>The rest of this section documents the view spec characters that are
presently supported and explains how to invoke a view spec.  There is no
user-level means of adding your own view spec characters, so all other
character codes are reserved for future use.

<span id="index-link"></span>
<span id="index-hyperlink"></span>
<span id="index-klink-1"></span>
<span id="index-_003c_003e-delimiters"></span>
<p>Cells may include hyperlinks that refer to other cells or to external
sources of information.  Explicit Hyperbole buttons may be created as
usual with mouse drags (see <a href="#By-Dragging">Creation Via Action Key
Drags</a>).  Implicit Hyperbole buttons may be added to Koutline text as
well.  A <em>klink</em> is a special implicit link button, delimited by
&lt;&gt; separators, that jumps to a koutline cell and may also adjust the
current outline viewspecs.  This section discusses klinks.
</p>
<span id="index-klink_002c-formats"></span>
<p>There are three forms of klinks:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><span id="index-internal-klink"></span>
<span id="index-klink_002c-internal"></span>
<span id="index-_003c_0023klink_003e"></span>
</dd>
<dt><span><em>internal</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>&lsquo;<samp>&lt;#2b=06&gt;</samp>&rsquo; is an internal klink, since it refers to the koutline
in which it is embedded.  When activated, it jumps to the cell within
the current outline which has permanent id &lsquo;06&rsquo; and relative id &lsquo;2b&rsquo;.
&lsquo;<samp>&lt;#06&gt;</samp>&rsquo; does the same thing, as does &lsquo;<samp>&lt;#2b&gt;</samp>&rsquo;, though this
latter form will not maintain the link properly if the cell is moved
elsewhere within the outline.  The form, &lsquo;<samp>&lt;#2b=06|ben&gt;</samp>&rsquo;
additionally sets the view spec of the current outline back to the
default value, with a blank line between each cell and the whole
outline visible.
</p>
<span id="index-external-klink"></span>
<span id="index-klink_002c-external"></span>
</dd>
<dt><span><em>external</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>The second klink format is an external link to another koutline, such
as, &lsquo;<samp>&lt;EXAMPLE.kotl#3=012|c1e&gt;</samp>&rsquo;, which displays the named file,
starting at the cell 3 (whose permanent identifier is 012), with the
view specification of: blank lines turned off, cutoff after one line
per cell, and showing ellipses for cells or trees which are collapsed.
</p>
<span id="index-klink_002c-view-spec"></span>
<span id="index-view-spec_002c-klink"></span>
</dd>
<dt><span><em>view spec</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>The third format sets a view spec for the current koutline.  For
example, &lsquo;<samp>&lt;|ben&gt;</samp>&rsquo;, when activated, sets the view in the current
outline to display blank lines, to use ellipses after collapsed lines
and to label cells with the alphanumeric style.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<span id="index-koutliner_002c-Action-Key_002c-klink"></span>
<span id="index-Action-Key_002c-klink"></span>
<span id="index-klink_002c-activating"></span>
<span id="index-klink-referent"></span>
<p>Press the Action Key over a klink to follow it.  This will flash the
klink as a button and then will display its referent in the other
window.  If the klink contains a view spec, it will be applied when
the referent is displayed.
</p>
<span id="index-klink_002c-inserting"></span>
<span id="index-koutliner_002c-C_002dc-l"></span>
<p>There are a number of easy ways to insert klinks into koutlines.  If you
have mouse support under Hyperbole, simply click the Action Key within
the indentation to the left of a cell text.  If you then double click on
some cell, a link to that cell will be inserted where you started.  From
a keyboard, use <kbd>{C-c l}</kbd> when in a koutline or <kbd>{C-h h k l}</kbd> when
not in a koutline to insert a klink.  Since klinks are implicit buttons,
you may instead type in the text of the klink just as you saw them in the
examples above and they will work exactly as if they had been entered with
the insert link command.
</p>
<span id="index-M_002dw"></span>

<span id="index-kotl_002dmode_003acopy_002dabsolute_002dklink_002dto_002dkill_002dring"></span>
<p>If you prefer the standard copy and yank model that Emacs provides, place
point within a klink when there is no active region and use <kbd>{M-w}</kbd> to
copy the klink.  To instead copy a reference to the current Koutline cell,
use <kbd>{M-w}</kbd> <em>outside of</em> a klink when no region is active or
<kbd>{M-x kotl-mode:copy-absolute-klink-to-kill-ring <span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> anywhere
within a cell.  Then <kbd>{C-y}</kbd> will yank the last copied text into any
buffer you desire.  Of course, when a region is active, <kbd>{M-w}</kbd> will
copy the region as it does normally in Emacs.
</p>

<span id="index-kotl_002dmode_003acopy_002dabsolute_002dklink_002dto_002dregister"></span>
<p>Similarly, you can copy to an Emacs register rather than to the kill ring.
When no region is active/highlighted, <kbd>{C-x r s}</kbd> prompts for an Emacs
register and saves to it either the current klink or, when outside of a
klink, a reference to the current cell.  <kbd>{M-x
kotl-mode:copy-absolute-klink-to-register <span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> anywhere within a cell
saves a reference to the current cell to a register.
</p>
<p><kbd>{C-x r i}</kbd> with the same register then inserts at point the Koutline
reference previously saved.  When a region is active, these operate on the
region instead.

<p>There are also commands without any builtin key bindings that always
copy a klink reference to the current cell:
</p><div class="example">
<pre class="example">kotl-mode:copy-absolute-klink-to-kill-ring
kotl-mode:copy-relative-klink-to-kill-ring

<span id="index-modes-to-ignore-klinks"></span>
<span id="index-klinks_002c-ignoring"></span>
<p>Because klinks use a very generic syntax, surrounded by &lt;angle brackets&gt;,
in certain modes, mostly C-based programming modes, certain non-klink syntax
can be mistakenly identified as klinks.  Therefore, the Koutliner provides
two customizable variables which disable klink recognition in selected major
modes, <code>klink:ignore-modes</code> and <code>klink:c-style-modes</code>.  Add a mode
to one of these if you find any syntax that improperly registers as a klink.
</p>
<p><code>klink:ignore-modes</code> is for non-programming modes, as Hyperbole ensures
that within all programming major modes, klinks are recognized only when point
is within a comment.
</p>
<p><code>klink:c-style-modes</code> is rarely needed but is there if Hyperbole ever
mistakenly recognizes a pattern within a comment as a klink when it isn&rsquo;t.

<span id="index-cell-attribute"></span>
<span id="index-attribute"></span>
<p><em>Attributes</em> are named properties whose values are specific to an
outline cell.  Thus, each cell, including the invisible 0 root cell,
has its own attribute list.  Every cell has three standard attributes:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dd><span id="index-idstamp-attribute"></span>
</dd>
<dt><span><em>idstamp</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>The permanent id of the cell, typically used in cross-file hyperlinks
that reference the cell, this is a whole number that starts from 0, which
is always the hidden root cell of the outline tree.

<span id="index-e_002dmail-address-1"></span>
<span id="index-mail-address"></span>

</p>
<span id="index-create_002dtime-attribute"></span>
<span id="index-cell-creation-time"></span>
</dd>
<dt><span><em>create-time</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>The time at which the cell was created.  This is stored in a form that
allows for easy data comparisons but is displayed in a human readable
format, such as &lsquo;<samp>Jan 28 18:27:59 CST 2021</samp>&rsquo;.

<p>The &lsquo;no-fill&rsquo; attribute is special.  When set to &lsquo;<samp>t</samp>&rsquo;, it
prevents movement, promotion, demotion, exchange, split or append

you from invoking explicit commands that refill the cell.

<span id="index-NLS"></span>
<span id="index-Augment"></span>
<span id="index-Engelbart"></span>
<p>Much of the Hyperbole outliner design is based upon concepts pioneered
in the Augment/NLS system, <cite>[Eng84a]</cite>.  Augment treated documents as
a hierarchical set of nodes, called statements, rather than cells.
Every Augment document utilized this intrinsic structure.
</p>
<span id="index-distributed-collaboration"></span>
<span id="index-collaboration"></span>
<p>The system could rapidly change the view of a document by collapsing,
expanding, generating, clipping, filtering, including or reordering
these nodes.  It could also map individual views to multiple workstation
displays across a network to aid in distributed, collaborative work.
</p>
<span id="index-knowledge-transfer"></span>
<span id="index-idea-structuring"></span>
<span id="index-cross-referencing"></span>
<p>These facilities aided greatly in idea structuring, cross-referencing,
and knowledge transfer.  The Koutliner is a start at bringing
these capabilities back into the mainstream of modern computing culture.

<p>Hyperbole includes HyRolo, a complete, advanced system for convenient
management of hierarchical, record-oriented information.  Most often
this is used for contact management but it can quickly be adapted to
most any record-oriented lookup task requiring fast retrieval.  There
is also a Python-based command-line version, <samp>hyrolo.py</samp>, included.
</p>
<span id="index-rolo_002c-buttons-in"></span>

<span id="HyRolo-Concepts-1"></span><h3 class="section">10.1 HyRolo Concepts</h3>

<span id="index-rolo-file"></span>
<span id="index-rolo-entry"></span>
<span id="index-hyrolo_002dfile_002dlist"></span>
<p>HyRolo manages and searches a list of rolo files stored in the
<code>hyrolo-file-list</code> custom option.  A <em>rolo file</em> consists of
an optional header that starts and ends with a line of equal signs (at
least three equal signs starting at the beginning of a line), followed
by zero or more rolo records which we call entries.
</p>
<span id="index-Org-mode"></span>
<span id="index-Markdown-mode"></span>
<span id="index-Emacs-Outline-mode"></span>
<span id="index-Koutline-mode"></span>
<p>The first file in the list should be a user-specific hyrolo file,
typically in the home directory and must have a suffix of either .org
(Org mode) or .otl (Emacs Outline mode).  Other files in the list may
use suffixes of .org, .otl, .md (Markdown mode) or .kotl (Koutline
mode).
</p>
<p>HyRolo <em>entries</em> begin with a delimiter of one or more special
characters followed by another space.  Delimiters vary based on the
type of file, for example level 3 entry delimiters look like this:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">Emacs Outline Mode: ***
Koutline Mode:      1b3 or 1.2.3
Markdown Mode:      ###
Org Mode:           ***
</pre></div>

<p>Entries may be arranged in a hierarchy, where child entries start with
at least one more delimiter characters than do their parents. Top-level
entries use either a single delimiter character or a sequence of digits
in the case of Koutlines.
</p>
<p>Beyond this initial delimiter, entries are completely free-form text.
It is best to use a &quot;lastname, firstname&quot; format, however, when adding
contact entries into the first HyRolo file in your list.  Then HyRolo
will automatically keep your entries alphabetized as you add them;
HyRolo can also sort the entries if you ever need.  HyRolo will use
this ordering if you accept the default entry with which it prompts
you when adding a new entry.
</p>
<span id="index-hyrolo_002ddate_002dformat"></span>
<p>Here is an example of a simple HyRolo file.  The date at the end is
automatically added by HyRolo whenever a new record is added, unless
<code>hyrolo-date-format</code> is set to the empty string.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">==================================================================
                          PERSONAL ROLO
&lt;Last-Name&gt;, &lt;First&gt;  &lt;Email&gt;        W&lt;Work#&gt;       F&lt;Fax#&gt;
==================================================================
*   Smith, John       &lt;js@hiho.com&gt; W708-555-2001  F708-321-1492
        Chief Ether Maintainer, HiHo Industries
        05/24/2020
</pre></div>

<p>Any search done on the rolo scans the full text of each entry.  During
a search, the rolo file header separator lines and anything in between
are appended to the buffer of matched entries before any entries are
retrieved from the file.  Whenever an entry is matched, it and all of
its descendant entries are retrieved.  If your emacs version supports
textual highlighting, each search match is highlighted for quick,
visual location.
</p>
<p>For example, a search on &quot;Company&quot; could retrieve the following:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">==================================================================
                        COMPANY ROLO
==================================================================
*    Company
**     Manager
***      Staffer
</pre></div>

<p>Thus, searching for Company retrieves all listed employees.
Searching for Manager turns up all Staffer entries.

</pre></div>

<p>The &rsquo;File&rsquo; menu item displays and edits the first file listed in
<code>hyrolo-file-list</code> unless given a prefix argument, in which case
it prompts with completion for the file to edit.
</p>
<p>A prefix argument used with any of the above menu items that have &rsquo;Find&rsquo;
in their names limits the search to a maximum number of matches given by
the argument.  The search is terminated whenever that number of matches
is found.
</p>
<p>With any of the above commands that prompt for a HyRolo name, such as
Edit or Add (not the Find commands), you may use the form parent/child
to locate a child entry below a specific parent.  Hence, for a HyRolo
which looks like so:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">*    Company
**     Manager
***      Staffer
</pre></div>

<p>you can refer to the Staffer entry with the following hierarchical
notation, Company/Manager/Staffer.  This hierarchical
notation is not used in search expressions since they search the
entire HyRolo anyway.  Thus, &quot;Staffer&quot; as a search pattern will find an entry
containing &quot;Staffer&quot; at any level in a hierarchy, like so:

<p>See <a href="#HyRolo-Menu">Rolo Menu</a>, for the list of HyRolo search commands.  In this
section, the menu item names from the minibuffer menu are used to
refer to each command.
</p>
<p>The <code>RegexFind</code> menu item searches the rolo list for all entries 
which contain matches for a given regular expression.  The regular
expression syntax used is the same as the one used within Emacs
and across the GNU set of tools.  See <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Regexps">Syntax of Regular
Expressions</a> in <cite>the GNU Emacs Manual</cite>, for full documentation on this
format.
</p>
<p>The <code>TagFind</code> menu item searches through HyRolo Org files and
finds headlines with any matching tags.  An Action Key press on any
matching line displays the line in its source buffer.
</p>
<p>The <code>WordFind</code> menu item locates full-word matches so that if you
search for &lsquo;<samp>product</samp>&rsquo;, it won&rsquo;t match to occurrences of
&lsquo;<samp>production</samp>&rsquo;.  It is also handy for more precise name matching.
</p>
<span id="index-logical-rolo-searches"></span>
<p>The <code>StringFind</code> menu item has two uses.  It can find all entry
matches for a string or can execute logical queries for more
precise matching.  The format of logical queries is explained here; a
simple parenthesis delimited prefix format is used with the following
logical operators.
</p>
<div class="example">

r-not           one           Match entries without the regexp arg
=====================================================================
</pre></div>


<p>For example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(and Company (not Vice-President))
</pre></div>

<p>would match those entries for people associated with &lsquo;<samp>Company</samp>&rsquo; who
do not have &lsquo;<samp>Vice-President</samp>&rsquo; titles.
</p>
<p>The following example would provide a list of all people marked as
clients whose area codes are outside of 408 and all non-clients within
the 408 area code.  This could be useful after all clients within
the 408 area code have been contacted and you want to see who else
you should contact.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(xor client 408- )
</pre></div>

<p>When using the regular expression operators, your operands are sent as
regular expressions without the need to quote single words or
special regular expression characters like &rsquo;*&rsquo; and &rsquo;?&rsquo;.  Use double
quote marks to include a phrase or multi-word regular expression pattern
to match.  For example:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">(r-and HyRolo &quot;Red Buttons?&quot;)
</pre></div>

<p>would match entries that contain both &quot;HyRolo&quot; and either &quot;Red Button&quot; or
&quot;Red Buttons&quot;.

<p>After a rolo search is performed, point is left in the <em>rolo
match buffer</em>, <samp>*HyRolo*</samp>, which uses <code>hyrolo-mode</code> to
simplify browsing many HyRolo matches.  Press <kbd>{?}</kbd> when in the
match buffer for a summary of available keys, all of which are
documented in this section.
</p>
<span id="index-rolo_002c-r"></span>
<span id="index-rolo_002c-search-again"></span>
<p>If your HyRolo search did not match what you want, use <kbd>{r}</kbd> to start
a new regular expression query or <kbd>{C-u r}</kbd> for a string query.  The
rest of the match buffer keys work with the search results currently
displayed.

<span id="index-rolo_002c-finding-matches"></span>
<span id="index-rolo_002c-moving-through-matches"></span>
<p>If your emacs version supports textual highlighting, each search match
is highlighted for quick, visual location.  <kbd>{<span class="key">TAB</span>}</kbd> moves
point forward to successive spans of text which match the search
expression.  If the matching text is hidden/invisible, it is shown;
the body of the entry with the match, as well as all of its sub-entries
are shown.  <kbd>{M-<span class="key">TAB</span>}</kbd> or <kbd>{<span class="key">SHIFT</span>-<span class="key">TAB</span>}</kbd> move
point backward to earlier matches.  These keys allow you to quickly
find the matching entry of most interest to you if your search
expression failed to narrow the matches sufficiently.

<span id="index-rolo_002c-locating-a-name"></span>
<p>To extend the match expression with some more characters to find a
particular entry, use <kbd>{M-s}</kbd>.  This performs an interactive search
forward for the match expression.  You may add to or delete characters
from this expression to find different occurrences or move to the next
match with <kbd>{C-s}</kbd>.  <kbd>{C-r}</kbd> reverses the direction of the
search.
</p>
<p>To search for a specific entry name in the match buffer, use <kbd>{l}</kbd>
to interactively locate the text immediately following the entry start
delimiter, typically one or more asterisks.  This lets you find
entries by last name quickly, eliminating other matches.  Standard
string, <kbd>{C-s}</kbd>, and regular expression, <kbd>{C-M-s}</kbd>, interactive
search commands are also available within the rolo match buffer.

<span id="index-rolo_002c-outline-of-entries"></span>
<p>Single key outlining commands are also available for browsing matches.
If your search matches a large number of entries, use <kbd>{t}</kbd> to get
a top-level summary of entries.  Only the first line of each
first-level match is shown.  If you want to see an overview of all the
levels, use <kbd>{o}</kbd> which shows the first line of every entry level.
If you want an overview of just the first two levels, <kbd>{C-u 2 o}</kbd>
will work.

<span id="index-rolo_002c-showing-entries"></span>
<p>Press <kbd>{s}</kbd> to show (expand) the entry at point if it is hidden
(collapsed).  If point is on a file header, this will expand the header
and show the entire set of matched entries for the file.  The <kbd>{h}</kbd>
does the reverse and hides entries.  Within file headers it hides the
file from the end of the current line forward, so you can leave parts of
the header displayed, if desired.  Press <kbd>{a}</kbd> to expand all entries
in the buffer across all matched files.
</p>
<p>If an entry is collapsed/hidden, moving to any hidden part
auto-expands it.  Use <kbd>{h}</kbd>, the hide entry subtree to hide it
again, if desired; this leaves point at the beginning of the entry
(does not apply in file headers) to facilitate further use of movement
by entry commands.

<span id="index-hyrolo_002dfile_002dlist-1"></span>
<span id="index-rolo_002c-personal"></span>
<p>The files used in any rolo search are given by the
<code>hyrolo-file-list</code> variable, whose default value is typically
<code>&quot;~/.rolo.otl&quot;</code>, in which case, searches scan only your personal
rolo file.  But you can customize this to include files with variables
in them, wildcard patterns and directories, as explained below.  Any
paths added to this list should be absolute.
</p>
<p>If you include file wildcards in paths for this variable and
<code>find-file-wildcards</code> is non-nil (the default), then any files
matching the pattern (which can include [char-matches] or * wildcards
and regular text) when the variable is set will be included in HyRolo
searches.  For more on wildcards, see <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Wildcards">Wildcards</a> in <cite>the GNU
Emacs Manual</cite>.
</p>
<p>If you include an Environment variable or Emacs Lisp variable with the
<code>${var}</code> format in a path, they also are resolved when
<code>hyrolo-file-list</code> is set.  Variables with values that include
multiple paths, e.g. PATH, are resolved to the first existing entry
that matches.
</p>
<p>If you include an existing directory (invalid ones are ignored) in
your <code>hyrolo-file-list</code>, HyRolo will expand it recursively across
all of its files that match <code>hyrolo-file-suffix-regexp</code>.  By
default, this is Org files (.org), Emacs outlines (.otl), Koutlines
(.kotl), or Markdown files (.md).  See <samp>hpath.el#hpath:expand-list</samp>.
</p>
<p>Once expanded, if a file in the list does not exist or is not
readable, it is dropped.  Paths are searched in the order in which
they appear in the list.  You should leave your personal rolo file as
the first entry in the list, since this is the only file to which the
HyRolo menu Add command adds entries.
</p>
<p>Hyperbole releases earlier than 4.17 used a different filename for the
personal rolo.  If such a file exists, you will be prompted to rename
it whenever the HyRolo system is loaded.
</p>
<p>If you want to have HyRolo search your directory of Org files, add the
following to your Emacs initialization file:
</p>
<div class="format">
<pre class="format">(add-hook &rsquo;hyperbole-init-hook
	  (lambda ()
	    (require &rsquo;org)
	    (setq hyrolo-file-list (append (hyrolo-initialize-file-list)
                                           (list org-directory)))))
</pre></div>

<span id="index-BBDB"></span>
<span id="index-Big-Brother-DataBase"></span>
<p>If you use the Big Brother DataBase (BBDB) Emacs package to capture
email addresses and store contact information, the rolo automatically
works with it.  If the BBDB package is loaded before HyRolo, then your
<code>bbdb-file</code> of contacts is added as the second entry in
<code>hyrolo-file-list</code> and will be searched automatically for any matches by
the rolo find commands.  Presently there is no support for editing
BBDB entries, just finding them.
</p>
<p>For finding matches within only BBDB, there are the commands
<code>hyrolo-bbdb-fgrep</code> (string finding) and <code>hyrolo-bbdb-grep</code>
(regular expression finding).  They may be bound to keys if desired.
</p>
<span id="index-contacts_002c-Google"></span>
<span id="index-Google-Contacts"></span>
<span id="index-Gmail-Contacts"></span>
<p>If you use Google/Gmail Contacts, you can configure the HyRolo to
query your Google Contacts for matches.  First you must download and
install the external <samp>google-contacts</samp> package using the Emacs
Package Manager.  Then you must install the non-Emacs GNU Privacy
Guard (GPG) package from <a href="https://gnupg.org">https://gnupg.org</a> so that
the <samp>gpg</samp> or <samp>gpg2</samp> executable is in your command-line
search path.  Once these are in place, either restart Emacs or
use <kbd>{M-x hyrolo-initialize-file-list <span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> to add Google
Contacts to your searches.
</p>
<p>When you next do a search, you will be prompted for your Google
Contacts password and may also have to enter an authorization code
that will be displayed on your screen.  After authorization, your
your information will be cached so that you are not prompted for
it again within this Emacs session.
</p>
<span id="index-hyrolo_002dgoogle_002dcontacts_002dfgrep"></span>
<span id="index-hyrolo_002dgoogle_002dcontacts_002dgrep"></span>
<p>For finding matches within only Google Contacts, there are the commands
<code>hyrolo-google-contacts-fgrep</code> (string finding) and
<code>hyrolo-google-contacts-grep</code> (regular expression finding).  They
may be bound to keys if desired.
</p>
<span id="index-hyrolo_002dgoogle_002dcontacts_002dflag"></span>
<p>If you ever need to disable Google Contacts usage, there is a
flag, <code>hyrolo-google-contacts-flag</code>, which when set to &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo;
disables searching of your Google Contacts.
</p>
<p>Below are the rest of the settings available with HyRolo:

<dd><p>If textual highlighting is available in your emacs on your current

the face which highlights search matches.

<dd><p>HyRolo file buffers are left around after they are searched, on the
assumption that another search is likely to follow within this emacs
session.  You may wish to change this behavior with the following
setting: <code>(setq hyrolo-kill-buffers-after-use t)</code>.

<dd><p>After an entry is killed, the modified rolo file is automatically
saved.  If you would rather always save files yourself, use this
setting: <code>(setq hyrolo-save-buffers-after-use nil)</code>.

<dd><p>When an entry is being added from within a mail reader buffer, the
rolo extracts the sender&rsquo;s name and e-mail address and prompts you
with the name as a default.  If you accept the default, it will enter
the name and the email address using the format given by the
<code>hyrolo-email-format</code> variable.  See its documentation if you want to
change its value.
</p>
</dd>
<dt id='index-hyrolo_002dhdr_002dregexp'><span><code>hyrolo-hdr-regexp</code><a href='#index-hyrolo_002dhdr_002dregexp' class='copiable-anchor'> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>A rolo file may begin with an optional header section which is copied
to the match display buffer whenever any matches are found during a
search.  The start and end lines of this header are controlled by the
regular expression variable, <code>hyrolo-hdr-regexp</code>, whose default value
is &quot;^===&quot;.  This allows lines of all equal signs to visually separate
matching entries retrieved from multiple files during a single search.
</p>
</dd>
<dt id='index-hyrolo_002dhdr_002dand_002dentry_002dregexp'><span><code>hyrolo-hdr-and-entry-regexp</code><a href='#index-hyrolo_002dhdr_002dand_002dentry_002dregexp' class='copiable-anchor'> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>The rolo entry start delimiter is given by the regular expression
variable, <code>hyrolo-hdr-and-entry-regexp</code>, whose default value is &quot;^\*+&quot;, i.e. 
one or more asterisks at the beginning of a line.
</p>
</dd>
<dt id='index-hyrolo_002ddisplay_002dformat_002dfunction'><span><code>hyrolo-display-format-function</code><a href='#index-hyrolo_002ddisplay_002dformat_002dfunction' class='copiable-anchor'> &para;</a></span></dt>
<dd><p>When a rolo search is done, each matching entry is passed through the
function given by the variable, <code>hyrolo-display-format-function</code>,
before it is displayed.  This should be a function of one argument,
namely the matching rolo entry as a string.  The string that this
function returns is what is displayed in the rolo match buffer.  The
default function used is <code>identity</code> which passes the string through
unchanged.  If you use the rolo code to search other kinds of
record-oriented data, this variable can be used to format each entry
however you would like to see it displayed.  With a little experience,
you can quickly write functions that use local bindings of the rolo
entry and file settings to search all kinds of record-oriented data.
There is never a need to learn a complicated query language.

<span id="index-file_002c-hywconfig_002eel"></span>
<p>This chapter explains Hyperbole&rsquo;s <samp>hywconfig.el</samp> library.  It lets you
save and restore window configurations, i.e. the layout of windows and
buffers displayed within an emacs frame.  This is useful to save a
particular working context and then to jump back to it at a later time
during an emacs session.  It is also useful during demonstrations to
display many informational artifacts all at once, e.g. all of the windows
for a particular subsystem.  None of this information is stored between
emacs sessions, so your window configurations will last through only a
single session of use.  Each window configuration is tied to the emacs
frame in which it is created.
</p>
<p>The hywconfig library offers two independent ways of managing window
configurations.  The first way associates a name with each stored
window configuration.  The name may then be used to retrieve the window
configuration later.  The second way uses a ring structure to save
window configurations and then allows cycling through the ring of
saved configurations, finally wrapping around to the first entry after
the last entry is encountered.  Simply stop when the desired
configuration is displayed.
</p>
<p>The Win/ menu entry on the Hyperbole top-level menu displays a menu of
hywconfig window configuration commands:
</p>
<pre class="verbatim">WinConfig&gt;  AddName  DeleteName  RestoreName  PopRing  SaveRing  YankRing

by name, but it requires that you type the chosen name.  Instead, the ring
commands permit saves and restores using only the mouse.  Since the ring
commands are a bit more complex than their by-name counterparts, the
following paragraphs explain them in more detail.
</p>
<span id="index-kill_002dring"></span>
<p>HyWconfig creates a ring structure that operates just like the Emacs
<code>kill-ring</code> (see <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Kill-Ring">Kill Ring</a> in <cite>the GNU Emacs Manual</cite>) but its
elements are window configurations rather than text regions.  You can
add an element to the ring to save the current window configuration in
the selected frame.  After several elements are in the ring, you can
walk through all of them in sequence until the desired configuration
is restored.
</p>
<span id="index-hywconfig_002dring_002dsave-1"></span>
<p>SaveRing executes the <code>hywconfig-ring-save</code> command which
saves the current window configuration to the ring.
</p>
<span id="index-hywconfig_002dyank_002dpop-1"></span>
<p>YankRing executes the <code>hywconfig-yank-pop</code> command.  It restores
the window configuration currently pointed to within the ring.  It
does not delete this configuration from the ring but it does move the
pointer to the prior ring element.  Repeated calls to this command
thus restore successive window configurations until the ring pointer
wraps around.  Simply stop when a desired configuration appears and
use <kbd>{q}</kbd> to quit from the minibuffer menu.
</p>
<span id="index-hywconfig_002ddelete_002dpop-1"></span>
<p>PopRing calls the <code>hywconfig-delete-pop</code> command.  It is used to
restore a previously saved configuration and to delete it from the ring.
Simply stop when a desired configuration appears and use <kbd>{q}</kbd> to
quit from the minibuffer menu.
</p>
<span id="index-hywconfig_002dring_002dmax"></span>
<p>The maximum number of elements the ring can hold is set by the
<code>hywconfig-ring-max</code> variable whose default is 10.  Any saves beyond
this value will delete the oldest element in the ring before a new one
is added.

<span id="Hook-Variables-1"></span><h3 class="section">12.1 Hook Variables</h3>

<span id="index-variables"></span>
<span id="index-hook-variables"></span>
<p>Hyperbole supplies a number of hook variables that allow you to adjust
its basic operations to meet your own needs, without requiring you to
change the code for those operations.
</p>
<span id="index-add_002dhook"></span>
<p>We find it best to always set the value of hook variables either to
&lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo; or to a list of function names of no arguments, each of which
will be called in sequence when the hook is triggered.  If you use
the <code>add-hook</code> function to adjust the value of hooks, it will do
this automatically for you.
</p>
<p>Given the name of a function, a Hyperbole hook variable triggered within
that function has the same name as the function with a &lsquo;<samp>-hook</samp>&rsquo;
appended.  Hyperbole includes the following hook variables:
</p>

<p>New forms of explicit buttons may be created by adding new action types
to a Hyperbole environment.  The file, <samp>hactypes.el</samp>, contains
many examples of working action types.
</p>
<span id="index-action-type_002c-creation"></span>
<span id="index-defact"></span>
<span id="index-actype_003acreate-1"></span>
<p>An action type is created, i.e. loaded into the Hyperbole environment,
with the <code>(defact)</code> function (which is an alias for
<code>(actype:create)</code>).  The calling signature for this function is
given in its documentation; it is the same as that of <code>(defun)</code>
except that a documentation string is required.  An interactive
calling form is also required if the action type has formal parameters
and is to be used in explicit or global button definitions.  Implicit
buttons never use an action type&rsquo;s interactive form; however, it is
good practice to include an interactive form since the type creator
cannot know how users may choose to apply the type.
</p>
<p>An action type&rsquo;s parameters are used differently than those of a
function being called.  Its interactive calling form is used to prompt
for type-specific button attributes whenever an explicit button is
created.  The rest of its body is used when a button with this action
type is activated.  Then the button attributes together with the action
type body are used to form an action that is executed in response to the
button activation.  The action&rsquo;s result is returned to the action caller
unless it returns &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo;, in which case &lsquo;<samp>t</samp>&rsquo; is returned to the
caller to ensure that it registers the performance of the action.
</p>
<p>An action type body may perform any computation that uses Emacs Lisp and
Hyperbole functions.
</p>
<span id="index-interactive-form"></span>
<span id="index-interactive"></span>
<p>The interactive calling form for an action type is of the same form as
that of a regular Emacs Lisp function definition (see the
documentation for the Emacs Lisp <code>(interactive)</code> form
or see <a data-manual="elisp" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/elisp.html#Interactive-Codes">Code Characters for &rsquo;interactive&rsquo;</a> in <cite>the GNU Emacs Lisp Reference Manual</cite>.  It may additionally use
Hyperbole command character extensions when the form is given as a
string.  Each such extension character <em>must</em> be preceded by a
plus sign, &lsquo;<samp>+</samp>&rsquo;, in order to be recognized, since such characters
may also have different standard interactive meanings.

<p>Implicit buttons leverage the same action types used by explicit and
global buttons but each carries an additional implicit button type
that defines the contexts in which it is active, e.g. major modes or
surrounding text.  Once an implicit button type definition is loaded
into Hyperbole, the Action and Assist Keys automatically recognize all
buttons of that type.  The Action Key activates the buttons and the
Assist Key summarizes their behavior and attributes.  With a single
definition, you can bring your text to life, activating implicit
hyperbuttons in thousands of documents with no other effort.
</p>
<p>There are three ways to create new implicit button types; the first
two are meant to allow non-programmers to extend Hyperbole with
simplified types.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">

<span id="Action-Button-Link-Types-1"></span><h4 class="subsubsection">12.2.2.1 Action Button Link Types</h4>

<p>The simplest way to create a new implicit link type (from which any
number of buttons can be recognized within text) is to create an
<em>action button link type</em>.
</p>
<p>A call to the <code>defal</code> macro of the form:
</p>
<p><code>(defal TYPE LINK-EXPR &amp;optional DOC)</code>
</p>
<p>will create a Hyperbole action button link TYPE (an unquoted symbol)
whose buttons always take the form of: <code>&lt;TYPE link-text&gt;</code> where
<code>link-text</code> is substituted into LINK-EXPR as grouping 1 (wherever
%s or \\1 is found) to form the link referent that is displayed for
each button.  Hyperbole automatically creates a doc string for the
type but you can override this by providing an optional DOC string.
</p>
<p>When the Action Key is pressed in a buffer between the start and end
delimiters and the text in-between matches to TEXT-REGEXP, then the
button is activated and does one of four things with LINK-EXPR:
</p>
<ol>
<li> executes it as a brace-delimited key series;
</li><li> displays it in a web browser as a URL;
</li><li> displays it as a path (possibly with trailing colon-separated line and column numbers);
</li><li> invokes a function or action type of one argument, the button text sans the function name, to display it.
</li></ol>

<p>For example, if you use Python and have a &lsquo;<samp>PYTHONPATH</samp>&rsquo; environment
variable, then pressing <kbd>{C-x C-e}</kbd> <code>eval-last-sexp</code> after
this expression:
</p>
<p><code>(defal pylib &quot;${PYTHONPATH}/%s&quot;)</code>
</p>
<p>defines a new action button link type called ’pylib’ whose buttons
take the form of:
</p>
<p><code>&lt;pylib PYTHON-LIBRARY-FILENAME&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>and display the associated Python libraries (typically Python source
files).  Optional colon separated line and column numbers may be given
as well.
</p>
<p>Therefore an Action Key press on:
</p>
<p><code>&lt;pylib string.py:5:7&gt;</code>
</p>
<p>would display the source for <samp>string.py</samp> (wherever it is
installed on your system) from the Python standard library with point
on the fifth line at the seventh character.

<span id="Implicit-Button-Link-Types-1"></span><h4 class="subsubsection">12.2.2.2 Implicit Button Link Types</h4>

<p>If you understand Emacs regular expressions (see <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Regexps">Syntax of
Regular Expressions</a> in <cite>the GNU Emacs Manual</cite>), you can create new
implicit button types without understanding how to program in Emacs
Lisp, aside from the instructions provided here.
</p>
<p>A call to the <code>defil</code> macro of the form:
</p>
<p><code>(defil TYPE START-DELIM END-DELIM TEXT-REGEXP LINK-EXPR
             &amp;optional START-REGEXP-FLAG END-REGEXP-FLAG DOC)</code>
</p>
<p>will create a new Hyperbole implicit button link TYPE (an unquoted
symbol), recognized in a buffer via START-DELIM and END-DELIM
(strings) and the TEXT-REGEXP pattern between the delimiters.  With
optional START-REGEXP-FLAG true, START-DELIM is treated as a regular
expression.  Similarly, a true value of END-REGEXP-FLAG treats
END-DELIM as a regular expression.  Hyperbole automatically creates a
doc string for the type but you can override this by providing an
optional DOC string.
</p>
<p>When the Action Key is pressed in a buffer between the start and end
delimiters and the text in-between matches to TEXT-REGEXP, then the
button is activated and does one of four things with LINK-EXPR:
</p>
<ol>
<li> executes it as a brace-delimited key series;
</li><li> displays it in a web browser as a URL;
</li><li> displays it as a path (possibly with trailing colon-separated line and column numbers);
</li><li> invokes a function or action type of one argument, the button text (sans the function name if an Action Button), to display it.
</li></ol>

<p>Prior to activation, for the first three kinds of LINK-EXPR, a
<code>replace-match</code> is done on the expression to generate the
button-specific referent to display.  Thus, either the whole button
text (&lsquo;<samp>\\&amp;</samp>&rsquo;) or any numbered grouping from TEXT-REGEXP,
e.g. &lsquo;<samp>\\1</samp>&rsquo;, may be referenced in the LINK-EXPR to form the
link referent.
</p>
<p>Here is a sample use case.  Let&rsquo;s create a button type whose
buttons perform a grep-like function over a current repo&rsquo;s git log
entries.  The buttons use this format: [&lt;text to match&gt;].
</p>
<p>The following defines the button type called <code>search-git-log</code> with a 
a key series action surrounded by braces:
</p>
<p><code>(defil search-git-log &quot;[&lt;&quot; &quot;&gt;]&quot; &quot;.*&quot; &quot;{M-: (hypb:fgrep-git-log \&quot;\\&amp;\&quot;) RET}&quot;)</code>
</p>
<p>or this simpler version skips the explicit text substitution (\\\\&amp;)
and instead uses the function that takes the button text as an argument:
</p>
<p><code>(defil search-git-log &quot;[&lt;&quot; &quot;&gt;]&quot; &quot;.*&quot; #’hypb:fgrep-git-log)</code>
</p>
<p>Place point after one of the above expressions and evaluate it with
<kbd>{C-x C-e}</kbd> <code>eval-last-sexp</code> to define the implicit button
type.  Then if you have cloned the Hyperbole repo and are in a
Hyperbole source buffer, an Action Key press on a button of the form:
</p>
<p><code>;; [&lt;test release&gt;]</code>
</p>
<p>will display one line per commit whose change set matches &rsquo;test
release&rsquo;.  An Action Key press on any such line will then display the
commit changes.
</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t mind extra text for every button, you could instead use
Action Buttons of the form: &lt;hypb:fgrep-git-log &quot;string&quot;&gt; to do the
same thing without any special definitions.

<span id="index-ibtype-return-val"></span>
<span id="index-ibtype-actype"></span>
<span id="index-ibtype-at_002dp"></span>
<p>An implicit button type is defined or updated via the <code>(defib)</code>
macro (<code>ibtype:create</code> is alias for this).  It may be called just
as <code>(defun)</code> is, but with a number of constraints.  The parameter
list should always be empty since no parameters will be used.  A
documentation string is required.  The last required form is the
<code>at-p</code> predicate which when non-&lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo;, must do three things:
</p><ol>
<li> determine if there is a button at point that matches the type being defined;
</li><li> if so, call <code>ibut:set-label</code> to identify the label text of the button;
</li><li> if so, call <code>hact</code> to invoke the button&rsquo;s action, typically using the label.
</li></ol>

<span id="index-ibut_003alabel_002dset"></span>
<span id="index-ibtype-ibut_003alabel_002dset"></span>
<p>The call to <code>ibut:label-set</code> may contain just the button&rsquo;s label
argument or the label plus its start and end positions in the buffer,
if you wnat the button to flash when pressed.
</p>
<span id="index-ibtype-hact"></span>
<p>The <code>hact</code> call, run whenever a button of the type is activated,
must be the last expression within the <code>at-p</code> form unless the
action itself ends with a call to <code>hact</code>.  This call will always
return &lsquo;<samp>t</samp>&rsquo; when the <code>at-p</code> form is tested for a boolean
value since the implicit button type&rsquo;s check has already evaluated
true before this is called.  The arguments to the call to <code>hact</code>
are an action function and whatever arguments it takes.  The action
may be a Hyperbole action type created with <code>defact</code> or a regular
Emacs Lisp function.  However, the action should not return &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo;
since any &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo; value returned is converted to &lsquo;<samp>t</samp>&rsquo; to ensure
the implicit button checker recognizes that the action has been
executed.
</p>
<span id="index-action-2"></span>
<span id="index-ibtype-action"></span>
<p>Action invocations have the form: <code>(hact actype &amp;rest
actype-arguments)</code> where <code>actype</code> is a Hyperbole action type
symbol or an Emacs Lisp function name or lambda;
<code>actype-arguments</code> are the arguments fed to the action invocation
when an implicit button of the type is activated.
</p>
<p>It is imperative that all actions (non-predicate code) be invoked
through the <code>(hact)</code> function or your ibtypes will not work
properly.  (Hyperbole first tests to see if any ibtype matches the
current context before activating any type, so it ensures that
<code>(hact)</code> calls are disabled during this testing).  Any action
types used in the definition of an implicit button type may be created
before or after the definition, but obviously, must be defined before
any implicit buttons of the given type are activated or an error will
result.
</p>
<p>If an implicit button type create is successful, the symbol that
Hyperbole uses internally to reference the type is returned.  On
failure, &lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo; is returned so that you may test whether or not the
operation succeeds.  Implicit button type names and action type names
may be the same without any conflict.  In fact, such naming is
encouraged when an implicit button type is the exclusive user of an
action type.

<span id="index-hui_003ahtype_002dhelp-_0027ibtypes"></span>
<span id="index-C_002dh-h-i-t"></span>
<p>When the Action Key is pressed, each implicit button type predicate is
checked in priority order and the first one whose <code>at-p</code> form
evaluates non-&lsquo;<samp>nil</samp>&rsquo; is activated (its action is run using the
button label at point).  The first time an implicit button type is
defined, it becomes the highest priority type; repeated definitions of
the same type update the type but do not change its priority order.
<kbd>{C-h h i t <span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> <code>(hui:htype-help 'ibtypes 'no-sort)</code>
displays the doc strings for all current implicit button types in
descending priority order.
</p>
<span id="index-ibtype_003adelete"></span>
<p>Call <code>(ibtype:delete)</code> to remove an implicit button type from a
Hyperbole environment.  It takes a single parameter which should be the
same type symbol used in the type definition call (not the Hyperbole
symbol returned by the call).  This will not delete the action type used
by the implicit button; that must be done separately.
</p>
<span id="index-ibtype_002c-help"></span>
<span id="index-ibut_003aat_002dp"></span>
<p>By default, a request for help on an implicit button will display the
button&rsquo;s attributes in the same manner as is done for explicit
buttons.  For some implicit button types, other forms of help will be
more appropriate.  If an Emacs Lisp function is defined whose name is
formed from the concatenation of the type name followed by
&lsquo;<samp>:help</samp>&rsquo;, e.g. <code>my-ibtype:help</code>, it is used as the
assist-action whenever the Assist Key is pressed, to respond to
requests for help on buttons of that type.  Any such function should
take a single argument of an implicit button construct.  (This is what
<code>(ibut:at-p)</code> returns when point is within an implicit button
context).  Remember that the standard help for buttons with custom
help functions is still available with <kbd>{C-h A}</kbd> for the Action Key
and <kbd>{C-u C-h A}</kbd> for the Assist Key.

<p>To programmatically query implicit buttons for their attributes, use

the <samp>hib-kbd.el</samp> file for an example of a custom help function.

<span id="index-hbut_003alabel_002dto_002dkey"></span>
<p>Hyperbole uses a normalized form of button labels called button keys (or
label keys) for all internal operations.  See the documentation for the
function <code>(hbut:label-to-key)</code> for details of the normalization
process.  The normalized form permits Hyperbole to recognize buttons that
are the same but whose labels appear different from one another, due to
text formatting conventions.  For example, all of the following would
be recognized as the same button.
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example">  &lt;(fake button)&gt;     &lt;( fake      button)&gt;

  Pam&gt;  &lt;(fake
  Pam&gt;    button)&gt;

  ;; &lt;(fake

<span id="index-button_002c-multiple-lines"></span>
<span id="index-button_002c-split-across-lines"></span>
<p>The last three examples demonstrate how Hyperbole ignores common fill
prefix patterns that happen to fall within the middle of a button label
that spans multiple lines.  As long as such buttons are selected with
point at a location within the label&rsquo;s first line, the button will be
recognized.  The variable <code>hbut:fill-prefix-regexps</code> holds the list
of fill prefixes recognized when embedded within button labels.  All
such prefixes are recognized (one per button label), regardless of the
setting of the Emacs variable, <code>fill-prefix</code>, so no user
intervention is required.

<p>Hyperbole uses a terse format to store explicit buttons and a more
meaningful one to show users and to manipulate during editing.  The
terse format consists solely of button attribute values whereas the edit
format includes an attribute name with each attribute value.  A button
in edit format consists of a Lisp symbol together with its attribute list
which holds the attribute names and values.  In this way, buttons may be
passed along from function to function simply by passing the symbol to
which the button is attached.  Most functions utilize the pre-defined
<code>hbut:current</code> symbol by default to store and retrieve the last
encountered button in edit format.

name/value format.  This separation permits the wholesale replacement of
the storage manager with another, with any interface changes hidden from
any Hyperbole client programming.

<span id="index-explicit-button_002c-programmatic-creation"></span>
<p>A common need when developing with Hyperbole is to create or to modify
explicit buttons without user interaction.  For example, an application
might require the addition of an explicit summary button to a file for
each new mail message a user reads that contains a set of keywords.  The
user could then check the summary file and jump to desired messages
quickly.
</p>
<span id="index-class_002c-ebut-1"></span>
<span id="index-file_002c-hbut_002eel-1"></span>
<p>The Hyperbole class &lsquo;<samp>ebut</samp>&rsquo; supports programmatic access to explicit
buttons.  Examine it within the <samp>hbut.el</samp> file for full details.
</p>
<span id="index-ebut_003aprogram"></span>
<p>The simplest way to create explicit buttons programmatically is to
call <code>ebut:program</code>.  This generates an explicit button at point
from LABEL, ACTYPE (action type) and any optional ACTYPE ARGS.
It inserts the LABEL text at point surrounded by &lt;( )&gt; delimiters, adding any
necessary instance number of the button after the LABEL.  ACTYPE may
be a Hyperbole action type name (from defact) or an Emacs Lisp
function, followed by a list of arguments for the actype, aside from
the button LABEL which is automatically provided as the first argument.
</p>
<p>For interactive explicit creation, use <code>hui:ebut-create</code> instead.
</p>
<span id="index-ebut_003acreate"></span>
<span id="index-ebut_003amap"></span>
<p>The documentation for <code>(ebut:create)</code> explains the set of
attributes necessary to create an explicit button.  For operations over
the whole set of buttons within the visible (non-narrowed) portion of a
buffer, use the <code>(ebut:map)</code> function.
</p>
<span id="index-gbut_003aebut_002dprogram"></span>
<p>Similarly, <code>gbut:ebut-program</code> programmatically adds global explicit
buttons at the end of the personal button file.

<p>The standard Hyperbole user interface has purposely been separated from
the Hyperbole backend to support the development of alternative
interfaces and the embedding of Hyperbole functionality within other
system prototypes.  The Hyperbole backend functionality that system
developers can make use of is called its Application Programming
Interface (API).  The API may be used to make server-based calls to
Hyperbole when Emacs is run as a non-interactive (batch) process, with
its input/output streams attached to another process.
</p>
<p>The public functions and variables from the following files may be
considered the present Hyperbole API:
</p>
<p><samp>hact.el</samp>, <samp>hargs.el</samp>, <samp>hbmap.el</samp>, <samp>hbut.el</samp>,
<samp>hhist.el</samp>, <samp>hmail.el</samp>, <samp>hmoccur.el</samp>, <samp>hpath.el</samp>,

<samp>hywconfig.el</samp> and <samp>set.el</samp>.
</p>

<p>Note when looking at these files, that they are divided into sections
that separate one data abstraction (class) from another.  A line of
dashes within a class separates public parts of the class from the
private parts that follow the line.
</p>
<p>This API does not include the Hyperbole Koutliner, as it has been
designed for interactive use, rather than programmatic extensibility.
You are welcome, however, to study its code, below the

with a set of values is an <em>action</em>.  <em>Actype</em> is a synonym
for action type.
</p>
<p>Internally, Hyperbole defines its own namespace for action types
defined with its <code>defact</code> macro by prefixing them with
<code>ibtypes::</code>.  Symbols with this prefix are regular Emacs Lisp
commands.

<dt><span><b>Augment</b></span></dt>
<dd><p>The Augment system, originally named NLS, was a pioneering research and
production system aimed at augmenting human intellect and group knowledge
processing capabilities through integrated tools and organizational
development strategies.  This approach led to the invention of much of
interactive computing technology decades ahead of other efforts, including:
the mouse, chord keyboards, screen windows, true hypertext, outline
processors, groupware, and digitally signed documents.
See <a href="#References">References</a>, which cites several Douglas Engelbart papers on the
subject.  The Koutliner demonstrates a few of the concepts pioneered in
Augment.

<dt><span><b>Buffer</b></span></dt>
<dd><p>An Emacs buffer is an editable or viewable text, possibly with special
formatting such as an outline or table.  It may also be attached to a
process, receiving and updating its text as the process handles
changing information.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><b>Button</b></span></dt>
<dd><p>A selectable Hyperbole construct which performs an action.  A button
consists of a set of attributes that includes: a textual label, a
category, a type and zero or more arguments.  <em>Explicit buttons</em>
also have creator, create time, last modifier, and last modifier time
attributes.
</p>
<p>Buttons provide user gateways to information.  Users see and
interact with button labels; the rest of the button attributes are
managed invisibly by Hyperbole and displayed only in response to user
queries.

<dd><p>Flymake is an Emacs library that lints your code in the background.
It provides <code>flymake-minor-mode</code> for source buffers and
<code>flymake-diagnostics-buffer-mode</code> for listing the linter issues
for a given source buffer.  Hyperbole extends this library with Smart

<dt><span><b>Frame</b></span></dt>
<dd><p>An Emacs frame displays one or more Emacs windows and widgets
(menubars, toolbars, scrollbars).  Under a graphical window system,
this is a single window system window.  On a dumb terminal, only one
frame is visible at a time as each frame generally fills the whole

<dt><span><b>Global Button</b></span></dt>
<dd><p>A Hyperbole button which is accessed by name rather than direct

actions such as jumping to common file locations or for performing
sequences of operations.  One need not locate them since they are
always available by name, with full completion offered.  All global
buttons are stored in the file returned by the function call,
<code>(gbut:file)</code>, and may be activated with the Action Key when

transfer and works with many types of hosts.  It allows you to use
remote pathnames that are accessible via Internet protocols just like
other pathnames, for example when finding a file.  Hyperbole
recognizes pathnames of the form,
<samp>/&lt;protocol&gt;:&lt;user&gt;@&lt;host&gt;:&lt;path&gt;</samp> and web URLs.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><b>Tree</b></span></dt>
<dd><p>The set of cells in a koutline that share a common root cell, including
the root cell.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><b>URL</b></span></dt>
<dd><p>A Universal Resource Locator specification used on the World-Wide web
to access documents and services via a multiplicity of protocols.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><b>View</b></span></dt>
<dd><p>A perspective on some information.  A view can affect the extent of the
information displayed, its format, modes used to operate on it, its
display location and so forth.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><b>View Spec</b></span></dt>
<dd><p>A terse string that specifies a particular view of a koutline or a link
referent.  If a view spec is active for a buffer, the view spec appears
within the modeline like so, &lt;|view spec&gt;.  See <a href="#View-Specs">View Specs</a>.

</p>
</dd>
<dt><span><b>Windows Grid</b></span></dt>
<dd><p>A feature of HyControl invoked with <kbd>{@}</kbd> which creates, lays out

<p>Once you have Emacs set up at your site, the stable, released version of
GNU Hyperbole may be installed by using the Emacs Package Manager.  If
you are not familiar with it, see <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Packages">Packages</a> in <cite>the GNU Emacs
Manual</cite>.  Releases are very rare and the in-development branch may be
many months and features ahead, so you may want to consider using either
the Elpa In-Development or Git In-Development installation instead.
</p>
<p>If you have Hyperbole installed and simply want to upgrade it, invoke
the Emacs Package Manager with <kbd>{M-x list-packages <span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd>,
then use the <kbd>{U}</kbd> key followed by the <kbd>{x}</kbd> key to upgrade all
out-of-date packages, Hyperbole among them.  Then skip the text below
and move on to the next section, see <a href="#Invocation">Invocation</a>.
</p>
<p>Otherwise, to download and install the Hyperbole package, you should add
several lines to your personal Emacs initialization file, <samp>~/.emacs</samp>.
(For further details, see <a data-manual="emacs" href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_mono/emacs.html#Init-File">The Emacs Initialization File</a> in <cite>the GNU Emacs Manual</cite>).

<p>The Elpa In-Development package pulls from the latest Hyperbole
development branch tip and does not require installation of any new
package manager software.  Since Hyperbole is a mature package, this is
usually fine to use and update on a day-to-day basis.  But new features
are tested on this branch and once in awhile it may break for a short
time before a fix is pushed.  With this branch you&rsquo;ll be able to submit
bug reports and feature requests but will not be able to submit pull
requests for changes to the developers; use the Git In-Development
Package instead for that.

<p>If you are old-school, don&rsquo;t like package managers, and prefer doing

</p>
<p>Download either:
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><span>1. a stable release tar.gz source archive from either:</span></dt>
<dd><p><a href="ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hyperbole/">ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/hyperbole/</a> or
<a href="http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/hyperbole/">http://ftpmirror.gnu.org/hyperbole/</a>, which will find the closest

<p>Then decompress and unpack the archive to a directory of your
choosing.  Move into the <samp>hyperbole-&lt;version&gt;/</samp> directory and execute
the following Posix shell command:
</p>
<p><code>make bin</code>
</p>
<p>to byte-compile the Hyperbole lisp files.  Then add the following

<p>When given a filename to display, Hyperbole first checks if its suffix
is matched by <code>hpath:native-image-suffixes</code>.  If so and if the
function <code>image-mode</code> is defined, it uses that mode together with
the value of <code>hpath:display-where</code> to display the image within an
Emacs buffer.
</p>
<p>If no match is found, the <code>hpath:internal-display-alist</code> variable
is checked for a filename match.  Its value is an association list
whose elements are (&lt;file-name-regular-expression&gt;
. &lt;function-of-one-arg&gt;) pairs.  Any path whose name matches
a &lt;file-name-regular-expression&gt; will be displayed by calling the
associated &lt;function-of-one-arg&gt; with the filename as the argument.
The first regular expression that matches each filename is the one
used.  This can be used to format raw data files for convenient
display.
</p>
<p>By default, this setting handles the following types of files:
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt><span><em>&bull; Audio Files</em></span></dt>
<dd><p>Major audio format files are played with the <code>play-sound-file</code> command.

<p>If you use Hyperbole under a window system,
the <code>hpath:get-external-display-alist</code> function in <samp>hpath.el</samp>
supports hyperlinks that open files using external, non-Emacs tools, e.g.
a pdf reader or a vector graphics viewer.
</p>
<p>The value returned by <code>hpath:get-external-display-alist</code> is determined
based on the window system supported by the current frame and the version
of Emacs in use.  This value is an association list whose elements are
(&lt;file-name-regular-expression&gt; . &lt;viewer-program-or-list&gt;) pairs.  Any
path whose name matches a &lt;file-name-regular-expression&gt; will be
displayed using the corresponding viewer-program or the first
viewer-program found on the system from a list of programs.  If a
&lt;viewer-program&gt; entry contains a &lsquo;<samp>%s</samp>&rsquo; string, the filename to
display is substituted at that point within the string.
Otherwise, the filename is appended to the &lt;viewer-program&gt;
entry.  Alternatively, the viewer-program may be a Lisp function that
takes a single filename argument.
</p>
<p>The association lists used by this function are stored in variables
for each available window system: <code>hpath:external-display-alist-macos</code>,
<code>hpath:external-display-alist-mswindows</code>, and
<code>hpath:external-display-alist-x</code>.  Examine and modify these
values to suit your needs.
</p>
<span id="index-hpath_003aexternal_002dfile_002dsuffixes"></span>
<p>Part of these values for each operating system come from the
variable, <code>hpath:external-file-suffixes</code>&rsquo;, which holds a regular
expression of operating system independent file suffixes to open outside
Emacs.

<p>Another option to consider modifying is <code>hpath:variables</code>.  This
option consists of a list of Emacs Lisp variable names, each of which
may have a pathname or a list of pathnames as a value.  Whenever a
Hyperbole file or directory link button is created, its pathname is
compared against the values in <code>hpath:variables</code>.  The first
match found, if any, is selected and its associated variable name is
substituted into the link pathname, in place of its literal value.
When a link button is activated, potentially at a different site,
Hyperbole replaces each variable in the link pathname with the first
matching value from this list to recreate the literal pathname.
Environment variables and Emacs Lisp variables delimited
by \&quot;${variable-name}\&quot; are also replaced whenever link paths are
resolved.
</p>
<p>This permits sharing of links over wide areas, where the variable values
differ between link creator and link activator.  The entire process
is wholly transparent to the user; it is explained here simply to help
you in deciding whether or not to modify the value of <code>hpath:variables</code>.

<span id="index-web-search-menu"></span>
<span id="index-customizing-web-search-menu"></span>
<p>The Find/Web menu offers quick access to major web search engines.  It
is typically bound to <kbd>{C-c /}</kbd> or if not, then <kbd>{C-h h f w}</kbd> is
always available.  Your standard web browser will be used to return
the search results.
</p>
<p>The <code>hyperbole-web-search-alist</code> variable controls the items in
this menu.  Elements of this alist are of the form:
(&lt;web-service-name&gt; . &lt;url-with-%s-parameter-or-command&gt;).  The first
capitalized character of each &lt;web-service-name&gt; must be unique for
minibuffer menu selection.  The second part of an element is either:
</p><dl compact="compact">
<dt><span>1.</span></dt>
<dd><p>a URL with an embedded %s indicating where to substitute a search term
that is interactively prompted for when the menu item is activated;
</p></dd>
<dt><span>2.</span></dt>
<dd><p>or an Emacs command symbol that interactively prompts for a URL and a
search term and then displays the search results.
</p></dd>
</dl>

<p>Advanced users can change the search engines listed in the Find/Web
menu with <kbd>{M-x customize-variable <span class="key">RET</span>
hyperbole-web-search-alist <span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd>.  Changes are automatically
reflected in the Hyperbole menus once applied.  Remember each search
engine name must begin with a unique letter and each URL must have a
%s format field indicating where to place the web search term when a
search is performed.
</p>
<p>You can change which browser is used with <kbd>{C-h h c w}</kbd>, the
Cust/Web-Search menu.  Below is the equivalent Hyperbole menubar menu.

<span id="index-remote-pathnames"></span>
<p>Hyperbole always recognizes URLs within buffers when the Action Key is
pressed on them.  But sometimes it is useful to enter a URL at a prompt
and have it displayed.  Hyperbole can recognize s/ftp and www URLs given to
the <code>find-file</code> command (or any other <code>find-file-*</code> commands).
But because there is added overhead with this feature, it is not enabled by
default.
</p>
<span id="index-menu-item_002c-Find_002dFile_002dURLs"></span>
<span id="index-menu-item_002c-Find_002dFile_002dAccepts_002dURLs"></span>
<p>To enable the feature, use the Hyperbole menu item Cust/Find-File-URLs
(or Find-File-Accepts-URLs on the Hyperbole/Customize pulldown
menu).  Either of these toggles acceptance of URLs.  When enabled the
string, URLs, appears in the parenthesized minor-mode section of the
modeline.
</p>
<span id="index-hpath_003afind_002dfile_002durls_002dmode"></span>
<span id="index-enabling-URLs-in-find_002dfile"></span>
<span id="index-browsing-URLs-in-find_002dfile"></span>
<p>To enable this feature each time you start the editor, add the
following to your personal initialization file after initializing
Hyperbole: <code>(hpath:find-file-urls-mode 1)</code>.
</p>
<span id="index-abbreviated-URLs"></span>
<span id="index-URLs_002c-abbreviated"></span>
<span id="index-Tramp-1"></span>
<p>Both full URLs and abbreviated ones, like <samp>www.gnu.org</samp>, are
recognized.  filename completion does not work with URLs; you
have to type or paste in the entire URL.  This feature will work only
if you have the builtin Tramp Emacs Lisp package; if you don&rsquo;t have
Tramp, an error message will be displayed when you try to enable
find-file URLs.

<p>This is largely for outline modes such as the Koutliner.  By default,
character-by-character interactive search on <kbd>{C-s}</kbd> will search

selected, the surrounding text remains visible.
</p>
<p>You can temporarily disable searching of hidden text by typing
<kbd>{M-s i}</kbd> while in an incremental search.  This key sequence
toggles that setting and makes searches look only at visible text (or
the reverse when invoked again).  The setting lasts through the
current interactive search only.

<p>When Hyperbole is run under a window system, it automatically
highlights any explicit buttons in a buffer and makes them flash when
selected.  The main setting you may want change is the selection of a
color (or style) for button highlighting and button flashing.  See
the <samp>hui-*-b*.el</samp> files for lists of potential colors and the
code which supports this behavior.  A call
to <code>(hproperty:cycle-but-color)</code> in the <samp>hsettings.el</samp> file
changes the color used to highlight and flash explicit buttons.
</p>
<span id="index-hproperty_003abut_002dflash_002dtime_002dseconds"></span>
<span id="index-button-flash-time"></span>
<p>You may also change the length of time in fractions of a second that a
button flashes by setting <code>hproperty:but-flash-time-seconds</code>.
</p>
<span id="index-hproperty_003abut_002dhighlight_002dflag"></span>
<p>Whether or not buttons are highlighted is controlled
by <code>hproperty:but-highlight-flag</code>, which defaults to &lsquo;<samp>t</samp>&rsquo;.
To disable highlighting, change this setting in <samp>hsettings.el</samp> or
use Hyperbole menu item, Cust/All-Options, and select the Hyperbole
Buttons group to edit its options.
</p>
<span id="index-hproperty_003abut_002dcreate"></span>
<p>If you read in a file with explicit buttons before you load Hyperbole,
these buttons won&rsquo;t be highlighted.  Load Hyperbole and then use
<kbd>{M-x hproperty:but-create <span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> to highlight the buttons in
the current buffer.

<p>Additionally, if <code>hproperty:but-emphasize-flag</code> is set to &lsquo;<samp>t</samp>&rsquo;,
then whenever the mouse pointer moves over an explicit button, it will
be emphasized in a different color or style.  This emphasis is in
addition to any non-mouse-sensitive button highlighting.

<p>The variable, <code>hkey-init</code>, controls whether or not any Hyperbole
key bindings are made when <code>hyperbole-mode</code> is active.  It is set
to &lsquo;<samp>t</samp>&rsquo; (true) by default in <samp>hyperbole.el</samp>.  This setting
means all Hyperbole key bindings will be initialized when Hyperbole is
loaded.  If you want to disable these bindings permanently, simply add
<code>(setq hkey-init nil)</code> to your <samp>~/.emacs</samp> file prior to the
point at which you load Hyperbole; then restart Emacs.  Henceforth,
you will have to choose the Hyperbole commands that you want to use
and bind those to keys.

<p>If you ever want to temporarily disable Hyperbole key and mouse bindings,
simply toggle Hyperbole minor mode off with the <code>hyperbole-mode</code>
command.  There is no default key binding for this command; use <kbd>{M-x

as part of any setting of <code>hyperbole-init-hook</code> within your
personal <samp>~/.emacs</samp> file.  For example:
</p><div class="example lisp">
<pre class="lisp">(add-hook 'hyperbole-init-hook

<p>Hyperbole includes over 200 automated test cases in the <samp>test/</samp>
subdirectory.  You can run all of them by moving to the Hyperbole home
directory in a Posix shell and run <code>make test-all</code> or <code>make
test</code> to run just non-interactive tests.  If any tests fail, you can
press the Action Key to see the source of the failure.  Full testing is
supported under POSIX systems only.
</p>
<p>With Hyperbole active, you can also define implicit buttons that run
individual or sets of Hyperbole tests.  The file <samp>hypb-ert.el</samp>
contains two action link types:
</p>
<div class="example">
<pre class="example"><code>hyperbole-run-test</code>  - run a single Hyperbole test by name
<code>hyperbole-run-tests</code> - run one more tests matching a pattern

Example uses with a press of the Action Key:

  Run the test hbut-defal-url:
    &lt;hyperbole-run-test hbut-defal-url&gt;

  Run the tests specified by the test selector hbut-defal:

<p>This appendix summarizes the specialized key bindings available when
editing a koutline with Hyperbole.  Each key is shown together with its
command binding and the documentation for that command.  Normal emacs
editing keys are modified to account for the structure within outlines.
An outliner command which overloads an emacs command named <em>cmd</em>
is named <em>kotl-mode:cmd</em>.

<p>This appendix documents Hyperbole&rsquo;s context-sensitive Smart Key
operations.  It is quite extensive and is meant for reference rather
than sequential reading.  See <a href="#Smart-Keys">Smart Keys</a>, for a description of the
Smart Keys.  That section also describes how to get context-sensitive
Smart Key help, with which you can explore Smart Key operation bit by
bit.
</p>
<p>What a Smart Key does depends on the context in which it is used.
Smart Key operations are context-sensitive.  Contexts are defined by
logic conditionals, e.g. when depressed here, if this is true, etc.
Each Smart Key context is listed in the order in which it will be
checked.  The first matching context is always the one applied.
Within each context, the actions performed by the Action and Assist
Keys are given.

<p>The contexts and actions in this section, like drags and modeline
clicks, apply only if you have mouse support within Hyperbole.  The
Smart Key operations in <a href="#Smart-Keyboard-Keys">Smart Keyboard Keys</a>, apply to both mouse
and keyboard Smart Key usage.
</p>
<p>The following section documents what the Smart Mouse Keys do in each
context, with the contexts listed in decreasing order of priority,
i.e. the first context to match is the one that is used.  If no
matching mouse key context is found, then the keyboard key contexts
are searched in order.

<p>There are also <em>drag</em> actions that work on delimited things.
Delimited things include parenthesized lists, single and double quoted
strings, bracketed arrays/vectors, sets with braces, programming
language functions and markup pair tags (e.g. &lt;div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt; in HTML).
</p>
<p>If no region is selected when the Action Mouse Key is dragged from a
thing delimiter to another location, it copies the delimited thing to
the release point of the drag.  The release location may be in the
same or a different buffer but if in the same buffer it must be
outside of the delimited thing itself.  Similarly, the Assist Mouse
Key kills (cuts) the delimited thing at its original location and
yanks (pastes) it at the new location.
</p>
<p>The start of the drag must be on the first character of the starting
or ending delimiter.  For strings and comments, the drag must start on
the first line of the thing.
</p>
<p>Experiment with these drag actions and you will quickly find them easy
to use and indispensable.

<span id="Suggestion-or-Bug-Reporting-1"></span><h2 class="appendix">Appendix F Suggestion or Bug Reporting</h2>

<span id="index-version-description"></span>
<span id="index-Hyperbole-version"></span>
<p>If you find any errors in Hyperbole&rsquo;s operation or documentation, feel
free to report them to &lt;bug-hyperbole@gnu.org&gt;.  Be sure to use the
<kbd>{C-h h m r}</kbd> Msg/Report-Hypb-Bug minibuffer menu item whenever you send a message
to this address since that command will insert important system
version information for you.
</p>
<p>If you use Hyperbole mail or news support (see <a href="#Buttons-in-Mail">Buttons in Mail</a>), a
press of your Action Key on the Hyperbole mail list address will
insert a description of your Hyperbole configuration information into
your outgoing message, so that you do not have to type it.  Otherwise,
be sure to include the version numbers of your editor, Hyperbole and
your window system.  Your Hyperbole version number can be found in the
top-level Hyperbole menu.
</p>
<p>Below are some tips on how best to structure requests and discussion
messages.  If you share information about your use of Hyperbole with
others, it will promote broader use and development of Hyperbole.
</p>
<ul>
<li> Always use your Subject lines to state the position that your message
takes on the topic that it addresses.

<div class="display">
<pre class="display">For example, write: &ldquo;Subject: Typo in top-level Hyperbole minibuffer menu.&rdquo;

rather than: &ldquo;Subject: Hyperbole bug&rdquo;
</pre></div>

</li><li> Statements end with periods, questions with question marks (typically),
and high energy, high impact declarations with exclamation points.  These
simple rules make all e-mail communication much easier for recipients to
handle appropriately.

</li><li> <span id="index-emacs_002dversion"></span>
Question messages should normally include your Hyperbole and Emacs
version numbers and should clearly explain your problem and surrounding
issues.  Otherwise, it is difficult for anyone to answer your question.
(Your top-level Hyperbole menu shows its version number and <kbd>{M-x
emacs-version <span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> gives the other.)

</li><li> If you ask questions, you should consider adding to the discussion by
telling people the kinds of work you are doing or contemplating doing
with Hyperbole.  In this way, the list is not overrun by messages that
ask for, but provide no information.
</li></ul>

<p>If you have suggestions on how to improve Hyperbole, send them to
&lt;hyperbole-users@gnu.com&gt; (<kbd>{C-h h m c}</kbd> minibuffer menu item
Msg/Compose-Hypb-Mail).  Here are some issues you might address:
</p>
<ul>
<li> What did you like and dislike about the system?
</li><li> What kinds of tasks, if any, does it seem to help you with?
</li><li> What did you think of the Emacs-based user interface?
</li><li> How was the Hyperbole Manual and other documentation?
</li><li> Was the setup trivial, average or hard?
</li><li> What areas of Hyperbole would you like to see expanded/added?
</li><li> How does it compare to other hypertext tools you have used?
</li><li> Was it easy or difficult to create your own types?  Why?
</li><li> Did you get any use out of the external system encapsulations?
</li></ul>

</div>
<span id="Questions-and-Answers-1"></span><h2 class="appendix">Appendix G Questions and Answers</h2>

<ol>
<li> As I discover the Zen of Hyperbole, will I become so enamored of its power that I lose all control of my physical faculties?

<p>This other-worldly reaction is of course an individual matter.  Some
people have canceled meditation trips to the Far East after
discovering that pressing the Action Key in random contexts serves a
similar purpose much more cheaply.  We have not seen anyone&rsquo;s mind
turn to jelly but with the cognition Hyperbole saves you, you might
just grow a second one.  Eventually, you will be at peace and will
understand that there is no adequate description of Hyperbole.  Just
let it flow through you.
</p>
<p>Ok, joking aside, now that we have your attention, here are some
serious questions and answers.
</p>
</li><li> <span id="index-Org_002dmode"></span>
Isn&rsquo;t Org-mode the same as Hyperbole?

<p>No, they offer very different capabilities when you compare them a bit
more deeply.  In fact, it makes sense to use them together and they
are highly compatible.  The only overlap we see is that Org-mode has a
more limited kind of hyperlinks and offers some BBDB integration as
Hyperbole does.  For a list of some differences, see:
<a href="https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Hyperbole">https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/Hyperbole</a>.
</p>
<p>Org-mode offers traditional Emacs outlining, todo list management,
agenda and diary management, so it is very complementary to Hyperbole.
It did not exist when Hyperbole was first developed.
</p>
<span id="index-hsys_002dorg_002denable_002dsmart_002dkeys-4"></span>
<p>Smart Key support for Org-mode is already in Hyperbole.  Use the
<code>hsys-org-enable-smart-keys</code> customization variable to control
the Smart Keys and <kbd>{M-<span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> when in Org-mode with
<code>hyperbole-mode</code> active.  <code>t</code> enables Smart Key support
everywhere.  The symbol, <code>:buttons</code>, is the default; it means the
Smart Keys are active only when point is within a Hyperbole button.  A
<code>nil</code> value means no Smart Key support; Hyperbole gives Org
complete control over <kbd>{M-<span class="key">RET</span>}</kbd> so that it behaves just as it
does normally in Org mode.
</p>
</li><li> <span id="index-Smart-Key-2"></span>
<span id="index-mouse-key-bindings"></span>
<span id="index-hmouse_002dsetup"></span>
<span id="index-hmouse_002dget_002dbindings"></span>
<span id="index-file_002c-hmouse_002dsh_002eel"></span>
How can I change the Smart Mouse Key bindings?

<span id="index-hmouse_002dsetup-1"></span>
<span id="index-hmouse_002dget_002dbindings-1"></span>
<p>Since the Smart Mouse Keys are set up for use under many different
Emacs configurations, there is no easy way to provide user level
customization.  Any mouse key binding changes require editing the
<code>(hmouse-setup)</code> and <code>(hmouse-get-bindings)</code> functions in the
<samp>hmouse-sh.el</samp> file.
</p>
<span id="index-file_002c-hmouse_002dkey_002eel"></span>
<span id="index-file_002c-hui_002dwindow_002eel"></span>
<span id="index-hkey_002dalist"></span>
<span id="index-hmouse_002dalist"></span>
<p>To make the Smart Keys do new things in particular contexts, define new
types of implicit buttons, see <a href="#Implicit-Buttons">Implicit Buttons</a>.
</p>
<p>The <code>hkey-alist</code> and <code>hmouse-alist</code> variables in
<samp>hui-mouse.el</samp> and <samp>hui-window.el</samp> must be altered if you want
to change what the Smart Keys do in standard contexts.  You should
then update the Smart Key summary documentation in the file,
<samp>man/hkey-help.txt</samp>, and then regenerate the readable forms of
this manual which includes that file.
</p>
</li><li> What if I get mail with a Hyperbole button type I don&rsquo;t have?

<p>Or what if someone sends a mail message with a button whose link
referent I can&rsquo;t access?
</p>
<p>You receive an error that an action type is not defined or a link
referent is not accessible/readable if you try to use the button.  This
is hardly different than trying to get through a locked door without a
key; you try the doorknob, find that it is locked, and then realize that
you need to take a different approach or else give up.
</p>
<p>Like all communication, people need to coordinate, which usually
requires an iterative process.  If you get a mail message with a button
for which you don&rsquo;t have the action type, you mail the sender and
request it.
</p>
</li><li> <span id="index-global-button_002c-modify"></span>
How can I modify a number of global buttons in succession?

<p>Rather than typing the name for each, it is quicker to jump to the
global button file and edit the buttons there as you would any
explicit or implicit buttons.  By default, the ButFile/PersonalFile
menu item takes you to the file where global buttons are saved.
Global buttons are saved near the end of this file.
</p>
</li><li> Why are button attributes scattered across directories?

<p>When you think of a hyperspace that you depend on every day, you
don&rsquo;t want to have a single point of failure that can make you
incapable of doing work.  With Hyperbole, if some directories become
unavailable for a particular time (e.g. the filesystems on which
they reside are dismounted) you can still work elsewhere with minimal
effect.  We believe this to be a compelling factor to leave the design
with distributed button attribute storage.
</p>
<p>This design also permits the potential addition of buttons to read-only
media.
</p>
</li><li> Why are action types defined apart from implicit button types?

<p>Any category of button can make use of any action type.  Some action
types are useful as behavior definitions for a variety of button
categories, so all action types are defined separately to give them
independence from those types which apply them.
</p>
<p>For implicit button types that require a lot of code, it is useful to
add a module that includes the implicit button type definition, its
action type definition and supporting code.  Then simply load that
module into your Emacs session.

</div>
<span id="Future-Work-1"></span><h2 class="appendix">Appendix H Future Work</h2>

<p>This appendix is included for a number of reasons:
</p>
<ul>
<li> to better allow you to assess whether to work with Hyperbole by
providing sketches of possible additions;
</li><li> to direct further development effort towards known needs;
</li><li> and to acknowledge known weaknesses in the current system.
</li></ul>

<p>Without any serious interest from users, progress on these fronts will
be slow.  Here are some new features we have in mind, however.
</p>
<dl compact="compact">
<dt><span>Button Copying, Killing, and Yanking</span></dt>
<dd><p>There is as yet no means of transferring explicit buttons among
buffers.  We realize this is an important need.  Users should be able
to manipulate text with embedded buttons in ordinary ways.  With this
feature, Hyperbole would store the button attributes as text
properties within the buffers so that if a button is copied, its
attributes follow.  When a buffer is saved, the attributes also will
be saved.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Koutliner View Mode</span></dt>
<dd><p>This will complement the Koutliner editing mode by using simple one
character keys that normally insert characters to instead modify the
view of a Koutline and to move around in it, for ease of study.
Switching between view and edit modes will also be simple.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Direct Manipulation</span></dt>
<dd><p>Hyperbole is designed to let you rapidly navigate and manipulate
large, distributed information spaces.  Being able to directly
manipulate entities in these spaces will accelerate understanding and
production of new information.  Already Hyperbole lets you drag
buffers, windows, files, and directories and place them where you
like.  But there is much more that can be done to allow for
higher-level browsing and information organization.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Trails</span></dt>
<dd><p>Trails are an extension to the basic history mechanism presently offered
by Hyperbole.  Trails will allow a user to capture, edit and store a
specific sequence and set of views of information for later replay by
other users.  Conditional branching may also be supported.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Storage of button data within button source files</span></dt>
<dd><p>The current design choice of storing buttons external to the source file
was made under the assumption that people should be able to look at
files that contain Hyperbole buttons with any standard editor or tool
and not be bothered by the ugly button data (since they won&rsquo;t be able to
utilize the buttons anyway, they don&rsquo;t need to see or have access to
them).
</p>
<p>In many contexts, embedding the button data within the source files may
be a better choice, so a provision which would allow selection of either
configuration may be added.  Here are some of the PROs and CONs of both
design choices:
</p><br>
</dd>
</dl>

<div class="example">
<pre class="example">           POSITIVE                        NEGATIVE

Button data in source file
           Documents can stand alone.      All edit operators have

           facility expansion for

           files.

           Files can be displayed and      Currently, attributes for
           printed exactly as they look.   a whole directory are
           No special display formatting   locked when any button
           is necessary.                   entry is locked.

           Button-based searches and
           database-type lookup operations
           need only search one file
           per directory.
</pre></div>
<br>
<br>

<dl compact="compact">
<dt><span>Forms-based Interfaces</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>This will allow one to create buttons more flexibly.  For example, button
attributes could be given in any order.  Entry of long code sequences,
quick note taking and cross-referencing would also be made easier.
</p>
</dd>
<dt><span>Collaboration Support</span></dt>
<dd>
<p>From the early stages of Hyperbole design, collaborative work
environments have been considered.  A simple facility has demonstrated
broadcast of button activations to a number of workstations on a local
area network, so that one user can lead others around an information
space, as during an online design review.  (This facility was never
adapted to the current Hyperbole release, however).  Nowadays you
could just use a screen sharing program.

  "Use a single key or mouse key to manipulate directory entries.

Invoked via a key press when in dired-sidebar-mode.  It assumes
that its caller has already checked that the key was pressed in
an appropriate buffer and has moved the cursor there.

If key is pressed:
 (1) within an entry line, the item is displayed for editing,
     normally in another window, or if it is a directory and
     `dired-sidebar-cycle-subtree-on-click' is t it will expand
     and collapse the entry
 (2) at the end of an entry line: invoke `action-key-eol-function',
     typically to scroll up proportionally, if an Action Key press; invoke
     `assist-key-eol-function', typically to scroll down proportionally,
     if an Asisst Key press;
 (3) on the first line of the buffer (other than the end of line),
     dired is run on the current directory of this dired-sidebar;
 (4) at the end of the first or last line of the buffer,
     this dired-sidebar invocation is hidden."

;;; Commentary:
;;
;; GNU Hyperbole (pronounced Gnew Hi-per-bo-lee), or just Hyperbole, is like
;; Markdown for hypertext, letting you use little or no markup in files to
;; produce easy-to-navigate hypermedia files.  It is an easy-to-use, yet
;; powerful and programmable hypertextual information management system
;; implemented as a GNU Emacs package.  It offers rapid views and interlinking
;; of all kinds of textual information, utilizing Emacs for editing.  It can
;; dramatically increase your productivity and greatly reduce the number of
;; keyboard/mouse keys you'll need to work efficiently.
;; 
;; Hyperbole lets you:
;; 
;; 1. Quickly create hyperlink buttons either from the keyboard or by dragging
;; between a source and destination window with a mouse button depressed.
;; Later activate buttons by pressing/clicking on them or by giving the name of
;; the button.
;; 
;; 2. Activate many kinds of `implicit buttons' recognized by context within
;; text buffers, e.g. URLs, grep output lines, and git commits.  A single key
;; or mouse button automatically does the right thing in dozens of contexts;
;; just press and go.
;; 
;; 3. Build outlines with multi-level numbered outline nodes, e.g. 1.4.8.6,
;; that all renumber automatically as any node or tree is moved in the
;; outline.  Each node also has a permanent hyperlink anchor that you can
;; reference from any other node;
;; 
;; 4. Manage all your contacts quickly with hierarchical categories and embed
;; hyperlinks within each entry.  Or create an archive of documents with
;; hierarchical entries and use the same search mechanism to quickly find any
;; matching entry;
;; 
;; 5. Use single keys to easily manage your Emacs windows or frames and quickly
;; retrieve saved window and frame configurations;
;; 
;; 6. Search for things in your current buffers, in a directory tree or across
;; major web search engines with the touch of a few keys.
;; 
;; The common thread in all these features is making retrieval, management and
;; display of information fast and easy.  That is Hyperbole's purpose.
;; 
;; ----
;;
;; See the "INSTALL" file for installation instructions and the "README" file
;; for general information.
;;
;; There is no need to manually edit this file unless there are specific
;; customizations you would like to make, such as whether a Hyperbole Action
;; Mouse Key is bound to the middle mouse button.  (See the call of the
;; function, `hmouse-install', below).

;; Other site-specific customizations belong in "hsettings.el".

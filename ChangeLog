    to try to fix this test.

* hpath.el (hpath:find, hpath:to-markup-anchor): Fix for directory pathnames so

    the buffer found.  Also, make 'hpath:to-markup-anchor' handle any special buffer
    types without attached buffers.

* hywiki.el (hywiki-get-org-insertion-punctuation-keys): Allow for symbol syntax
    chars and rename to 'hywiki-get-buttonize-characters'.
            (hywiki-remap-org-insertion-punctuation-keys): Rename to

            (hywiki-find-page): Use this function as the 'find-file-hook' instead
     of 'hywiki-highlight-page-names'; make 'page-name' optional for this use since

     this function creates the page buffer, then enable hywiki-mode and call
     'hywiki-highlight-page-names'.

* hui-em-but.el (hproperty:but-clear-all-in-list, hproperty:but-get-all-in-region):
    Add.

* hywiki.el (org-mode-hook): Don't make 'find-file-hook' buffer local, as this

    hywiki-highlight-page-name): Don't limit to files within 'hywiki-directory';
    use whenever 'hywiki-mode' is enabled.

* hact.el (actype:act, action:params): Add Emacs 30 closure support.

2024-05-06  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

2024-05-05  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hpath.el (hpath:delimited-possible-path): Rewrite to expand both delimited
    and non-delimited shell pathnames.

    For non-delimited strings, remove any leading or trailing spaces;
    otherwise, may prepend a dir with an extra space in there when
    extracting paths from an ls command that are indented to match the
    column indent of filenames with quotes around them.  Also, remove
    requirement that shell buffer filenames be tab delimited and require
    that filenames with spaces in their names have quotes around them.
           (hpath:at-p): If file is readable, ignore whether it has "::" in it.

    `hywiki-org-link-type' only when 'hywiki-org-link-type-required' is non-nil.
             (hywiki-store-link): Rename to 'hywiki-org-link-store'.  Insert
    `hywiki-org-link-type' only when 'hywiki-org-link-type-required' is non-nil.
	     (hywiki-org-link-type): Change value from 'hy:' to 'hy'.
	     (hywiki-page-list): Rename to 'hywiki-get-page-list'.
	     (hywiki-get-pages): Rename to 'hywiki-get-page-hasht'.

    When 'property' is given, clear the button only when property's value
    matches 'value'.
                (hproperty:but-p, hproperty:but-get): Add optional args
    'property' and 'value', matching only when 'property' equals 'value', if
    given.

2024-04-20  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-select.el (hui-c++-defun-prompt-regexp): Add to eliminate an Emacs
    hang in c++-mode caused by setting 'defun-prompt-regexp'.  Update
    provided by Alan Mackenzie.  Fixes Emacs bug#61436 from 2023
    and gh#rswgnu/hyperbole/issue-518 from 2024.

2024-04-16  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyrolo.py: For Org files, create hyrolo match file header from all
    initial buffer-level '#+PROPERTY:' lines.

* hib-social.el (github-reference): Allow for a - character following
    commit, issue or pull keywords; already supported / and = characters.
                (gitlab-reference): Allow for a - character following
    any ref-type keyword.

* hui-select.el (hui-select-initialize): Disable C++ defun selection regexp until
    regexp is rewritten to prevent Emacs hangs.  See Emacs bug#61436 from 2023
    and gh#rswgnu/hyperbole/issue-518 from 2024.

2024-04-14  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

* test/hbut-tests.el (hypb--gbut-act-with-web-link): Test for gbut:act
    on a web link.

2024-04-14  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyrolo.py: Add this file for command-line search for string matches in HyRolo
    files.
 Makefile (HYPERBOLE_FILES): Add hyrolo.py.

* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist):
  hmouse-tag.el (smart-prog-at-tag-p, smart-prog-tag): Add default
    handlers for programming languages that have xref support but no other
    specific Hyperbole features.

* hsys-xref.el (hsys-xref-identifier-at-point, hsys-xref-item-at-point): Add so
     do not expose any internal xref call outside of this library.
  hui-mouse.el (hsys-xref): Switch to using 'hsys-xref-item-at-point' and add
    (require 'hsys-xref).

* hbut.el (ibut:create): Set 'name-start' and 'name-end' location attributes
    when previously set in call of 'ibut:set-name-and-label-key-p'.

* hbut.el (hbut:act): Fix to set current buffer to button 'loc attribute and
    to not set delim-text-start/end to use name start/end but only label.
          (hbut:funcall): Fix to set button's 'loc attribute to 'key-src'
    when given.  Otherwise, activation of a global button from another buffer
    would not set the actual location of the button.

* hsys-org.el (hsys-org-link-at-p): Org treats URLs with and without
    angle brackets as Org links but Hyperbole handles such links separately.
    Fix to match only to Org links within square brackets.  This also fixes
    a problem where activating a URL global button fails because the Org
    open link code could not handle having point originally in another buffer.

* hbut.el (ibtype:delete):
  hact.el (actype:delete): Make interactive with completion.
    Remove call to 'symtable:delete' since following call to
    'htype:delete' does that.

2024-04-13  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hsettings.el (hyperbole-web-search-alist):
  man/hyperbole.texi (Implicit Button Types, Menus):
  hib-social.el (social-reference): Update to use 'x' anywhere 'twitter'
    was previously allowed; either one is now usable for the same service
    name.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Action Types):
  hib-social.el (github-reference): Github links have largely moved from
    using 'tree' to 'blob', so fix this.  Also fix doc so that if not
    given a ref-type keyword, assume ref-type is to a file.

2024-04-10  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hbut.el (ibut:insert-text): Fix when given a command-name to output proper
    action button, not a nil with nil arguments.

2024-04-09  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-python-tag): Rewrite to just try to display a tag
    and signal an error if fail.  Return non-nil if succeed.
                (smart-python): Rewrite to call 'smart-python-tag' first
    so uses xref backend which may be something like 'eglot' or a TAGS file
    in preference to 'jedi' and other Python def lookup methods.
                (smart-tags-display): Fix for newer versions of 'xref' which
    return an 'xref-match-item' sometimes rather than an 'xref-item'.  Document
    this function.
                (smart-asm, smart-javascript, smart-python-tag, smart-java-tag)
                 smart-c++-tag, smart-c, smart-fortran, smart-objc-tag):
    Remove searching messages to match other languages.

2024-04-07  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-consult-grep-paths): Fix handling of zero 'max-matches'
    arg which triggers headline only searches.
            (hyrolo-move-to-entry-end): Handled named signals as well as
    errors.

* hibtypes.el (org-link-outside-org-mode): Fix by removing this test:
    (eq hsys-org-enable-smart-keys t) since should follow Org links outside
    Org modes independent of this setting, as long as the Hyperbole mode
    is active.

* Makefile (version, HYPERBOLE_FILES, TEXINFO_SRC):
  test/hpath-tests.el (hpath:prepend-shell-directory-test):
  man/hyperbole.texi: Remove "version.texi" file and include here to simplify
    doc build recipes.

2024-04-05  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

* test/hmouse-drv-tests.el (hbut-defil-verbatim): Add test for reported
    issue gh#rswgnu/hyperbole/503.

2024-04-01  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

* test/hpath-tests.el (hpath:prepend-shell-directory-test):
* test/demo-tests.el (demo-manifest-test): Replace COPYING with DEMO since
    it is not exported in all installations, i.e. MELPA.
    (hpath:prepend-shell-directory-test): Use kotl-mode.el instead of
    version.texi which is not exported.

2024-04-01  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

    hyrolo-consult commands.
            (hyrolo-consult-grep): Rewrote to select files to search within
    the grep command itself for greatly increased speed.
            (hyrolo-consult-org-roam-grep, hyrolo-consult-org-roam-title): Add.

2024-03-31  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-consult-grep): Convert any non-nil prefix arg
    'max-matches' to a number so it is utilized.

* test/hbut-tests.el (hbut-tests--ibut-at-p-identifies-a-remote-pathname):
    Code now fixed so this test passes; remove expected failure clause.

2024-03-31  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

* Makefile (coverage): Make target to use the coverage function from the
    command line.

* test/hy-test-coverage.el: New test file for producing test coverage
    data. Uses the testcover package.

    grouping 1 rather than the entire delimited string.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Top):
  man/version.texi: Update version to 9.0.2pre.

* hibtypes.el (mail-address): Move so lower priority than 'pathname' ibtype
    so that Tramp paths with embedded email addresses don't trigger as
    'mail-address' but as 'pathname'.
  man/hyperbole.texi (Implicit Button Types): Change priority here too.  Add
    'org-id', 'org-link-outside-org-mode' and 'python-tb-previous-line' ibtypes
     doc.

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-grep-file): Remove this line that was skipping past the
    beginning of the first matching entry regexp and making matching entry
    count too low by 1:
      (re-search-forward hyrolo-hdr-and-entry-regexp nil t)

* hpath.el (hpath:expand-list): Fix to properly expand a dir when 'exists-flag' is t.

2024-03-30  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-highlight-matches): Limit search to within 'end' bound.
            (hyrolo-add-match): Add 'headline-only' flag to limit match highlighting
    to within the headline of an entry only (its first line).
            (hyrolo-grep-file): Send 'hyrolo-add-match' the 'headline-only' flag; this
    fixes match highlighting to just within headlines when the flag is given.

* hyrolo (hyrolo-grep-file): Fix to highlight only the original pattern match, not
    the bol-anchored search-pattern used when 'headline-only' non-nil is used.

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-next-match-function): Change doc so function takes only one arg now
    and not a second arg of 'headline-only'.  That arg is now only sent to the higher
    level 'hyrolo-grep-file' function for efficiency.
            (hyrolo-next-regexp-match): Remove second 'headline-only' flag.
            (hyrolo-grep-file): With 'headline-only' flag, anchor pattern to match
     headline lines only and don't send 'headline-only' flag to 'hyrolo-next-match-function'
     call.  This fixes headline-only searching which previously did not work properly.
  hyrolo-logic.el (hyrolo-<logical-operator>): No longer send a nil second arg to the
     'hyrolo-next-match-function' call; no longer needed.

2024-03-29  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

* Makefile (lint): Rename 'package-lint' target to 'lint' and doc in comments.

  hyrolo-logic.el (hyrolo-logic): Change call from 'hyrolo-find-file' to

    'key-src'.

* hsys-org.el (hsys-org-fix-version): Add.  Add .org suffix to
    'auto-mode-alist' as it may be removed in this function.  Return
    t when Org is reloaded, nil if not.  Require Org libraries even
    when no reload is done.  Handle when 'org-version' differs from
    version number in 'org-dir'.
  hyperbole.el (hyperb:init): Add call to 'hsys-org-fix-version' when
    detect a mixed version installation of Org, typically part of
    built-in Org loaded before loading a newer packaged version.

* hargs.el (hargs:at-p): Fix 'no-default' arg handling to not select
    non-existent dirs and files when no-default is true.

* hsys-xref.el (hsys-xref-definitions): Fix to pass symbol, not string to

    advice.

* hpath.el (hpath:variables): Move 'load-path' and 'exec-path' before
    'Info-directory-list' as they should be higher priority matches.
    Remove old 'Info-directory'.

2024-01-12  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hypb.el (hypb:display-file-with-logo): Expand any folded headings
    in the file.

    Improve use in tests by doing the following when in batch mode
    (noninteractive): Kill off any non-modified buffer showing the file
    to display before freshly reading it.

2024-01-10  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Move 'smart-eolp' to immediately before
    'smart-org' clause.
  hsys-org.el (hsys-org-cycle-bob-file-list): Add to list files auto

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-verify): Remove mentions of HyNote (not in this release).

* hypb.el (hypb:display-file-with-logo): Remove call (skip-syntax-forward "-")
    so point stays at the beginning of buffer for Org global display cycling.
    Replace 'id-browse-file' and 'view-mode' with 'hyrolo-mode'.

* hsys-flymake.el (repeat-mode): Add missing (require 'repeat) since
    'repeat-mode' function used herein is not autoloaded.

2024-01-09  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hsys-xref.el: Add forgotten file.

2024-01-09  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

    (hyrolo-tests--outline-next-visible-heading-kotl)
    (hyrolo-tests--outline-next-visible-heading-all-file-types)
    (hyrolo-tests--outline-show-when-moving-out-of-hidden-line): Add more
    test cases for hyrolo outline show, hide and movement.

    (hyrolo-tests--gen-kotl-outline, hyrolo-tests--verify-hidden-line)
    (hyrolo-tests--verify-not-hidden-line): Add helper functions and use.

2024-01-09  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hact.el (htype:def-symbol, htype:names, actype:def-symbol): Change call
    from 'make-symbol' to 'intern' for efficiency.

2024-01-07  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

          (ibut:at-type-p): Rewrite using 'ibtype:elisp-symbol' and
    'ibut:type'.
          (ibut:is-type-p): Add to give both an ibut and a type for
  comparison and API use.
         (ibtype:def-symbol, hattr:report): Change call from 'make-symbol'
  to 'intern' for efficiency.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-tags-noselect-function): Change function reference
    to new name, 'hsys-xref-definition'.

* MANIFEST:
  Makefile (EL_COMPILE):
  hsys-xref.el (hsys-xref-definitions): Move xref utility functions
    from "hmouse-tag.el" to here and add Hyperbole unique hsys- prefix.

* test/hy-test-helpers.el (hy-delete-files-and-buffers): Add helper for
    cleaning up multiple files and buffers.

2024-01-06  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

* Makefile (HYPB_ERT_BATCH, HYPB_ERT_BATCH_BT):  Add command line arg to
    run test specified by selector. Example to run all hyrolo tests

      make test SELECTOR=hyrolo

    Bonus. Control size of backtraces so that we get more info on
    errors. For full backtrace add command line argument FULL_BT=

      make test SELECTOR=hyrolo FULL_BT=

2024-01-06  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* Makefile (test-all): Revert to use 'ert-run-tests-interactively' again
    instead of 'ert-run-tests-batch' so get interactive *ert* features
    including {b} to show backtraces for failed tests.  With new updates,
    now can run a previously run test from its definition with the Action
    Key and it will simply update the result in the existing buffer rather
    than overwriting the buffer with just that test.

* test/hypb-ert-tests.el (hypb-ert-tests--edebug-is-called): Fix this
    test by removing mock of `edebug-defun' which is necessary to set
    the symbol property that registers the name as an ert test.  Without
    this, `hypb-ert-run-test-at-definition' will not run the test.

2024-01-05  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* test/hypb-ert-tests.el (hypb-ert-tests--edebug-is-called):
  hypb-ert.el (hypb-ert-run-test-at-definition,

               hyperbole-run-test-definition:help): Remove 'test-name' arg
    and find any name at point instead.  Return t if run a test, else nil.
    Simplify logic.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-emacs-lisp-mode-p): Include 'ert-results-mode'.
                (smart-lisp-find-tag): Allow 'tag' arg to be a symbol,
    not just a string.  This allows it to be used as a target function
    in 'find-function-regexp-alist' which is used in the ert results buffer
    with the {.} command to jump to the ert test definition at point.
                (xref-definitions, xref-definition): Rewrite to handle
    ert-deftests.

* Makefile (test-all): Change 'ert-run-tests-interactively' to
    'ert-run-tests-batch' because this shows tracebacks of any tests that
    fail in the *Messages* buffer, speeding debugging.  Although it does
    have the side-effect of not producing the interactive *ert* buffer that
    lets you jump to test source.  However, you can paste the test results
    into another Emacs and use Hyperbole to jump to test/symbol definitions.
           (test-all-output): Save outputs including backtraces written
    to *Messages* buffer in file "ERT-OUTPUT".

* test/hib-kbd-tests.el (kbd-key-hy-demo-factorial-test): Remove use of *ert*
    buffer which may not exist if run in batch mode.

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-any-file-type-problem-p): If problem occurs within a 'let',
    then show backtrace so know where the let-binding was set.

2024-01-04  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-org-mode): Force font-lock-mode off in this major mode for speed.
            (hyrolo-funcall-match): Add optional arg 'backward-flag' to select
    proper major mode for a *HyRolo* match file when moving backwards.
  test/hyrolo-tests.el (hyrolo-tests--outline-next-visible-heading,
                        hyrolo-tests--outline-next-visible-heading-two-sections):
    Fix tests to work with fixed {n} and {p} commands.

* hui-mouse.el (hsys-flymake): Move loading of this library here from "hibtypes.el".
  hsys-flymake.el (hsys-flymake-issue-at-point, hsys-flymake-issue-at-point:help):
    Remove this ibtype and its :help function.  Hyperbole uses 'hkey-alist' Smart
    Key invocations of functions from this file instead now.
    Also, add documentation of all commands and key bindings.

* test/hyrolo-tests.el: Changed all 'header' to 'heading'.
    (hyrolo-tests--generate-heading-contents-for-tests): Generalized to take
    a 'heading-prefix-char' argument, to allow for markdown outline generation
    as well.

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-hdr-move-after-p): Fix and improve to handle point
    anywhere within a file header, not just on delim or loc lines.
            (hyrolo-outline-next-visible-heading,
             hyrolo-outline-previous-visible-heading): Fix to handle file
    headers properly when moving more than one entry at a time.

2024-01-03  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-mouse.el (smart-eolp): Change 'hsys-flymake-get-issue-at-point' to
    correct 'hsys-flymake-get-issue-at-position' call.
               (hkey-alist): If in the flymake linter list of issues buffer,
    jump to or show issue at point.
  man/hkey-help.txt:
  man/hyperbole.texi (Implicit Button Types): Remove
    'hsys-flymake-issue-at-point' ibtype (use {C-c C-l g} command instead.
    Document new 'hkey-alist' behavior from above.
* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key - Occurrence Matches): Move to proper
    priority order.
                     (Smart Key - Flymake Mode): Add and add table of
    Hyperbole key bindings in source buffer 'flymake-mode'.
                     (Glossary - Flymake): Add.
                     (Implicit Button Types): Remove hsys-flymake ibtype
    since would only apply if no other type applies and this could be
    confusing and inconsistent to users.  Leave it commented out in the
    code so a user can enable it at a higher priority if desired.

* hypb-ert.el (hypb-ert-run-test-at-definition): Fix to edebug function
    when not previously defined.
  test/hypb-ert-tests.el (hypb-ert-tests--edebug-is-called): Make edebug
    test work.

* hib-debbugs.el (declare-function): Revert declarations to use
    "ext:debbugs-gnu" from "ext:debbugs" since the newer package
    does not have many of the functions that Hyperbole presently uses.

* MANIFEST:
  man/hkey-help.txt:
  man/hyperbole.texi (Implicit Button Types):
  hibtypes.el (hsys-flymake):
  Makefile (EL_COMPILE): Add "hsys-flymake.el" to Hyperbole.

2024-01-02  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hibtypes.el (text-toc): Fix doc on whitespace handling before and after
    TOC header and TOC entry lines.
  hactypes.el (text-toc): Fix not handling different whitespace in TOC
    entry vs. section header.

* hui.el (hui:hbut-help): Return custom button help function symbol if any;
    otherwise, return the function used, 'hbut:report.  This is used in
    Smart Key help which previously was not displaying the proper action
    for the Assist Key when on a Hyperbole button.
  hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help): Update to display proper Assist Key help.

2023-01-02  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

2024-01-01  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hypb-ert.el (hypb-ert-def-at-p): Update doc.  Fix grouping ref that was
   1 that should have been 2 since optional "\\(-async\\)" added to the
   regexp.

2023-12-31  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hbut.el (ibut:create, ibut:at-p): Change to call 'smart-eolp' instead of
   'eolp' so can handle flymake issues where an overlay/char-property is
   added at the end of a line only and we want an implicit button created
   for this.

* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Add logic for new hsys-flymake library to handle
    diag issues at the end of the line where we want an implicit button to
    fire rather than typically eol handling.

* hbut.el (ibtype:test-p, ibtype:act): Add these to mirror actype functions.
          (ibtype:elisp-symbol): Add alias similar to existing actype one.  So
    that (ibtype:act <ibtype-sym-or-name>) executes the ibtype action if the
    current buffer context supports it.

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-file-list): Add 'hyrolo-set-file-list' after loading the hyrolo
    library (at the end of the file) if 'hyrolo-file-list' has been set by the
    user or the customization system prior to loading HyRolo.

2023-12-30  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-show-levels): Add top-level save-excursion so point does
    not move.
            (hyrolo-outline-next-visible-heading): Rename
    'hyrolo-next-visible-heading' to this.

* FAST-DEMO (Action Buttons): Update to include ert test definition within
    the file so do not have to load all of the test files to run the demo.

* hbut.el (ebut:label-p): For <action> buttons, allow unlimited length
    button labels since might be an entire long sexpression.

* hib-debbugs.el (debbugs-gnu-query:list): Debbugs support libary has been renamed
    from 'debbugs-gnu' to just 'debbugs'.

2023-12-29  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* test/hui-tests.el (hui--link-possible-types): Make use .otl rather than .outl
    file suffix which automatically invokes 'outline-mode'.

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-to-entry-end): Fix bug where HyRolo fgrep would get stuck
    in Org buffers without any outline delimiters due to this function moving
    backwards.

* HY-ANNOUNCE:
  README.md:
  FAST-DEMO (Introductory Videos): Add 3 EmacsConf 2023 videos on Hyperbole.

* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Add 'ert-results-mode' support using rsw's new

* hypb-ert.el (hypb-ert-def-at-p): Add support for `ert-deftest-async' from the
    "ert-async.el" package.

* hactypes.el (text-toc): Tighten section matching by ensuring it matches to the
    beginning of the text of the line aside from any initial whitespace.
    Previously, it could match to any part of the line and was not regexp-quoted,
    leading to occasional mis-matches.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp-at-non-htype-tag-p): Fix to remove any action button
    trailing '>' character.  Already removed any leading '<'.  Match to symbol
    and word chars between <> to handle all action button labels.
  hibtypes.el (action): Add support for executing ert-deftests and update doc
    string for this.
  man/hyperbole.texi (Action Buttons):
  DEMO (Using Action Buttons):
  FAST-DEMO (Action Buttons): Add example action button of a Hyperbole ert test.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-window-link): Invert the meaning of the prefix arg, so without
    one, creates implicit buttons and with creates explicit buttons.  This is the new
    V9 standard as then by default there is no need to prompt for a button name.
  hui-window.el (hmouse-alist-add-window-handlers): Invert drag between windows so
    without a prefix arg, creates implicit buttons and with, creates explicit ones.
  hui.el (hui:ibut-link-directly):
  FAST-DEMO (Implicit Buttons):
  DEMO (Creation via Dragging, Creation via Ace Window):
  man/hyperbole.texi (Keyboard Drags, Smart Mouse Drags between Windows):
  man/hkey-help.txt: Update doc on above.

  test/demo-tests.el: Set enable-local-variables to nil for test cases
    where DEMO and FAST-DEMO is loaded to avoid getting queried.

2023-12-26  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hpath.el (hpath:to-markup-anchor): If 'referent-regexp' starts with '^', add
    "[ \t]*" instead of "[ \t]+" to the expression in case it matches the whole line.

* hui.el (hui:link-possible-types): Change outline heading line link to trigger only
    for outline, org and kotl modes when point is anywhere on the heading line.
    Include non-zero column in pathname so returns to the original point.  Produce a
    'link-to-string-match' type.
  hbut.el (ibut:insert-text): Change 'actypes::link-to-string-match' to use a pathname
    format ibut rather than a <link-to-string-match> action button when the occurrence
    number is 1.

* hui-select.el (hui-select-scan-sexps): Don't use 'hui-select-syntax-table' in Lisp
    modes as its use of matching angle brackets prevents proper sexp selection when
    on the opening parentheses of anything with angle brackets inside, e.g. (< 2 3).

* hyrolo-logic.el (hyrolo-fgrep-logical): Fix quoting for Lisp read and regexp
    operator handling.
  hyrolo.el (hyrolo-fgrep): Fix to handle 'r-<operator>' regexp logic operators.

		  (hyrolo-fgrep-logical): Rename arg 'whole-buffer-flag' to
    'koutline-flag' to match its purpose.  Does not seem to be sent as true
    anywhere in the existing code base.

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-hdr-in-p): Add to test if in a HyRolo file header.
            (hyrolo-hdr-to-first-line-p): Add to move to file header start.
	    (hyrolo-outline-hide-subtree): If point is on a file header in the
    'hyrolo-display-buffer', then collapse the entire file from the current
    end-of-line forward.  This makes {h} work within file headers.
            (hyrolo-hdr-move-after-p): Handle point on single text line between
    header delimiters.
            (hyrolo-outline-show-subtree): If point is on a file header in the
    'hyrolo-display-buffer', then show/expand the entire file.  This makes {s}
    work within file headers.

    separator or @loc> line.
            (hyrolo-outline-up-heading): Rewrite and fix to handle edge cases.

    property when possibly hierarchical name is found/used so can jump to the
    specific line within an entry when editing.
            (hyrolo-to): Fix to jump to stored current line and col after finding
    a possibly hierarchical name in HyRolo.

* man/hyperbole.texi (HyRolo Keys): Update doc for 'hyrolo-edit', {e} key, and
    how it handles datestamps.  Mention 'hyrolo-date-format'.

* hactypes.el (link-to-kcell): Fix to use any source location, e.g. in HyRolo
    display matches buffer.

* hsys-org.el (hsys-org-agenda-item-at-p):
  hui-mouse.el (smart-org):
  man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key - Org Mode): Update doc to note the context is
   an Org agenda item within an Org agenda view, not the item in its source
   context.

* test/hy-test-helpers.el (hy-test-helpers:ensure-link-possible-type): Add.
  test/hui-tests.el (hui--link-possible-types): Use above function to ensure

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-map-matches, hyrolo-funcall-match): Ensure point ends up
    on a visible point so that reveal-mode does not force and unhide of the entry.
    Remove the above logic from 'hyrolo-show-levels' since it calls
    'hyrolo-map-matches'.
            (hyrolo-mode): For now, stop enabling 'reveal-mode'  until can get it
     working right with the enabling of 'outline-minor-mode' when switch major modes
     in "*HyRolo*", typically using 'hyrolo-funcall-match' or 'hyrolo-map-matches'.

* hyrolo.el (require 'reveal): Add since overload its functions now.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:reveal-toggle-invisible): Fix by adding
    'get-buffer' call around 'hyrolo-display-buffer'.  Otherwise, the buffer

       key bindings.
            (hyrolo-overview, hyrolo-top-level): Simplify for new version of

* man/hyperbole.texi (HyRolo Keys): Document [ and ] keys to move to prev and
    next buffer/file @loc> line.

    to capture all Markdown suffixes.
            (hyrolo-any-file-type-problem-p): Use above regexp here.  Separate out
    invalid files due to invalid suffixes from files with invalid major modes due
    to not being in 'auto-mode-alist'.
            (outline-mode-hook): Add to configure outline-mode for use with HyRolo.
	    (hyrolo-org-mode): Update to set all local hyrolo variables.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode): Set 'outline-regexp' to match 'hyrolo-hdr-and-entry-regexp'
    to account for file headers in 'hyrolo-mode' (multi-format major-mode).

    that HyRolo cannot handle and to install the markdown-mode package as
    necessary when a Markdown file is specified in 'hyrolo-file-list'.
            (hyrolo-let-file-list, hyrolo-set-file-list): Call above function.
    This fixes failures with Markdown files improperly put into fundamental-mode
    which means their headings are not recognized properly.
            (hyrolo-to-previous-loc, hyrolo-to-next-loc): Add and
    bind to [ and ] keys in 'hyrolo-mode-map'.
    (hyrolo-hdr-prefix-regexp): Add so do not repeat expression multiple places
       and add this to `outline-regexp' in all major-modes supported by HyRolo.

    by removing one '#' from expected heading level.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:reveal-toggle-invisible): May be in the

	    (hyrolo--cache-major-mode): Fix so stored matched buffer major-mode rather
    than hyrolo-mode from the display matches buffer.  Also, reused cached major-mode-index
    values when the major-mode is the same and increment index only when not reused.
            (hyrolo-map-matches, hyrolo-funcall-match): Eliminate save-restriction calls.

2023-12-03  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hibtypes.el (annot-bib): Lower priority below 'org-link-outside-org-mode'
    as this can be mistaken for an org link outside an org buffer.

* hactypes.el (link-to-regexp-match): Fix typo.

* hui.el (hui:link-possible-types): Set no-default when checking if
    at a filename; otherwise, will match at any point in a file-based
    buffer, which is only supposed to trigger at the end of the possible
    matches when 'buffer-file-name' is checked.

* test/hyrolo-tests.el (hyrolo-sort-test): Temporarily set to known
    :failing, as is a known bug.

2023-12-02  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

    when non-nil, replaces existing dates but does not add new ones;
    use as part of an edit command.  Do nothing if 'hyrolo-date-format'

    that HyRolo supports where you don't want a date added when jumping
    to and editing entries.
            (hyrolo-edit-date): Add for use with 'hyrolo-edit-hook'.

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-add): Fix that narrow-to-region was narrowing to a
    zero-sized region when point was not on an entry start character.
    Also fix that when moved to point-max trying optimized insertion
    but failing, never moved point back to point-min, so insertion
    would occur at the buffer end rather than the proper point.

* hargs.el (hargs:delimited): Remove use of 'bounds-of-thing-at-point'
    and (require 'thingatpt) since it doesn't use the delimiters given
    and returns wrong results.  This fixes defal tests that were failing.

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-grep): Fix to ensure 'outline-regexp' setting for all
    matching file types is set locally in the match buffer only.
            (hyrolo-mode): Use 'setq-local' instead of 'make-local-variable'.
	    (require 'outline): Add and remove its function declarations.

    that are not yet expanded.  Use 'hpath:expand-list' to expand them.
           (hpath:expand-list): Fix to call 'hpath:expand' before resolving
    wildcards, so that variables are resolved first.  Also make 'match-regexp'
    argument optional, in which case all files are matched.  Improve doc string.

2023-11-30  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-grep-file): Add 'backward-search-limit' to minimize
    backward searches to the end of the last match and to prevent

    variable settings (starts with -*-, e.g. for Org mode as the first
    line.

    (hyrolo-fgrep-and-goto-next-visible-kotl-heading-level-2)
    (hyrolo-fgrep-and-goto-next-visible-kotl-heading-cell-2): Add test for
    moving to next header and that action-key then brings you to the

    all files types are searched, matches and give proper @loc>-header.

* hyrolo.el: Move private variables before their first use to remove
    warnings.

* Remove warnings for unknown functions by using declare-function.

2023-11-23  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-select.el (hui-select-syntax-table): Change to copy syntax
    table so changes do not affect the parent.

* hbut.el (hbut:modify-syntax): Add <> and {} pair support in text
    and fundamental modes.
          (require 'mode-local): Use in 'hbut:modify-syntax'.
  hib-kbd.el (defib kbd-key): Remove explicit syntax setting of braces
    and just temporarily use Hyperbole-modified text-mode syntax table.
  hyrolo.el (hyrolo-mode-syntax-table): Remove explicit syntax setting
    of < > delimiters; inherit from 'text-mode-syntax-table' instead.

* test/hui-select-tests.el (hui-select--thing): Fix to skip 'indent-def
    by removing final newline.  Label each test section with the type
    of match expected.

2023-11-22  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

* test/demo-tests.el (fast-demo-key-series-dired-other-window): Add test
    from demo key series.

2023-11-22  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Add clause to handle Smart Key when in
    a vertico minibuffer window; make it behave like standard vertico
    which exits and selects the first minibuffer line, not the candidate
    presently selected.

* hui-select.el (hui-select-scan-sexps): Add to fix brace handling
    as a matching pair when selecting things by using previously
    unused 'hui-select-syntax-table'.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp-bound-symbol-def): Rewrite to support
    Hyperbole type defs like defib, etc.  This improves finding
    the proper definition of a Hyperbole type.

                 find-defib-regexp, find-defil-regexp): Add these
    entries to 'find-function-regexp-alist'.

2023-11-21  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-select.el (hui-select-initialize): Fix to set 'syntax-table-sym'
    and 'keymap-sym' locally within the function rather than globally
    which would affect modes beyond those in 'hui-select-markup-modes'.
                (hui-select-goto-matching-delimiter): If the key that
    invokes this command in hyperbole's minor-mode is also bound in the
    current major mode map, then interactively invoke that command
    instead.  Typically prevents clashes over {C-c .}.  Previously
    did this only for 'org-mode' but 'kotl-mode' also has a conflict
    that this fixes.
                (hui-select-thing): Apply the same above fix for
    {C-c RET}, {C-c C-m}.
  hui-mini.el (hui-search-web): Apply the same above fix for {C-c /}.

    robust and/or simpler.

* TAGS: Remove from git but keep including in packages and tarballs.

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-windows-grid): Update to defer to outline
    mode keybindings in much fewer contexts.  Most windows-grid prefix

    is read-only when created.

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-windows-grid-by-file-pattern): Fix to error
    when num-files or grid-size is zero.

* FAST-DEMO (Implicit Buttons, Hyperbole Explicit and Global Buttons):
    Update to document implicit and explicit link button creation with
    two or more windows on screen.

    definitions.
                (smart-entire-tags-table-list): Add to compute full list
    of tags tables to use.  Use in 'smart-tags-display' and in
    'smart-tags-find-p'.
                (smart-tags-find-p): Fix that an existing 'tags-table-list'
    was overriding 'smart-tags-file-list'.
  HY-NEWS (ERT Test Case Symbols Jump to Definition): Document new smart
    tags support for ert test case symbols.

    point before splitting the cell.

* HY-CONCEPTS.kotl: Expand and improve button descriptions
  FAST-DEMO: Add pointers to "HY-CONCEPTS.kotl", default to Org mode with
    Smart Keys active.

2023-11-17  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

    'hyrolo-find-file' call to ensure current buffer is the first hyrolo file.
                       (hyrolo-sort-test): Change to use 'hyrolo-find-file'.

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-mode-outline-level): Fix to handle all file formats that
    HyRolo now supports but ignore Emacs outline entry matches without trailing
    whitespace or of formfeeds, as these can cause a hang in HyRolo search.
            (hyrolo-outline-level): Add to handle 'outline-level' calculation
    unique to standard HyRolo entries (asterisk with a following whitespace
    character).
            (hyrolo-find-file): Improve 'outline-regexp' handling and set
    'outline-level' function if an Emacs outline.
	    (hyrolo-add): Compare entry-regexp against default-value of
    'hyrolo-hdr-and-entry-regexp' rather than a literal string.

2023-11-14  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-sort): Fix bug where 'hyrolo-sort-level' had assumed
    the file to sort was in the current buffer but 'hyrolo-sort' had not
    read in that file.
            (hyrolo-map-level, hyrolo-sort-level): Remove 'hyrolo-file' arg
    since had already been using current buffer instead.

* test/hpath-tests.el (hpath:find-report-lisp-variable-path-name-when-not-exists):
    Update test and doc to simply verify that 'hpath:find' errors when called
    with a non-existent path.

* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Comment out unreleased hynote-mode clause.

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-buffer-exists-p): Fix for improved buffer-name matching

    position of the beginning of the match.
            (hyrolo-next-regexp-match): Change to return (match-beginning 0)
    rather than the end.

    the current line as the entry.
            (hyrolo-name-at): Rename to 'hyrolo-name-at-p'; change return value
    to a cons of (<entry-name> . <entry-source>).  If no entry delimiters,

    text property to it.

            (hyolo-edit): Fix to search only over a specified file.
            (hyrolo-helm-org-rifle): Fix to filter out any non-file buffers.
            (hyrolo-kill): Change to not switch buffers since shows whether the
    record was killed or not.

* hpath.el (hpath:expand, hpath:expand-list): Add optional exists-flag to return
    nil if expanded path does not exist.

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo--expanded-file-list, hyrolo-set-file-list,
             hyrolo-file-list-changed): Finish support for recursively
    searching dirs and expanding file wildcards in 'hyrolo-file-list' by

  HY-NEWS (HYROLO): Document the above new feature.
            (hyrolo-edit): Improve 'completing-read' prompt.
	    (rolo-display-buffer, rolo-file-list, rolo-entry-regexp): Remove all
  of these variables that have been obsolete since V6.  Use hyrolo- prefix instead.
            (hyrolo-grep): Rewrote for compatibility with new caching scheme.

2023-11-11  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-initialize-file-list): Completely remove this function,
    obsolete since V8.0.1.  Use `hyrolo--initialize-file-list' instead.

2023-11-06  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui.el (hui:link-possible-types): Fix CI/CD build error where ilink was
    inserted when pathname was expected due to batch diff when referent is
    in dired-mode.  Fix to skip button type clauses in this case.
  test/hui-tests.el (hui--ibut-link-directly-to-dired): Check that looking
    at a string before trying to (read (current-buffer)); otherwise,
    'read' will fail.

2023-11-05  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* test/hyrolo-tests.el (hyrolo-demo-show-overview): Fix by adding
    needed (forward-line 1) before testing for a collapsed node.

    compatible with Emacs 27.1 and dependable regardless of what
    is in the dired buffer.

* hpath.el (hpath:substitute-var-name): Fix to not elide variable name
    from path unless path contains an Emacs loadable file name suffix.

* hui-mouse.el (smart-dired): If hit default cond clause and no filename
    on the current line, run dired on the current directory rather than
    triggering an error with a null filename value.
               (smart-dired-pathname-up-to-point): Always return dir
    as a full path ending in a forward slash.  Add optional 'no-default'
    arg and use in 'hargs:at-p' when reading a directory and in 'dired-mode'.

* hui.el (hui:link-possible-types): Fix so when checking if a file ref
    at point, link to the file without any position arg and don't default
    to the current 'buffer-file-name', instead drop through to further
    conditional clauses.

* hbut.el (ibut:insert-text): Fix 'actypes::link-to-file' to shorten arg1
    path relative to source dir, not referent dir.

2023-10-30  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

                 klink:update-label, klink:yank-handler, klink:absolute):
    Update to new file#cell-ref|viewspec syntax.

  HY-NEWS: Add recent updates such as 'hsys-org-consult-grep' and refill
    paragraphs to a common width.

* hui-em-but.el (eval-when-compile (require 'hyrolo)): Comment this out because
    it causes klink ibtype to load with the wrong priority (before hibtypes.el
    loads it).  See comment in the file.
  hinit.el: Fix so hibtypes is loaded before hui-menu to prevent klink defib
  priority from being set improperly.

* kotl/kcell.el (kcell:ref-to-id): Handle string labels at the beginning of cells.
  kotl/kview.el (kcell-view:cell-from-ref): Fix to handle strings returned from

2023-10-28  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hpath.el (hpath:find): Fix off-by-one (too high) error with relative line
    numbers.  A relative line number of 1 means the first line, not the line
    after the first line, i.e. don't move at all, which of course can be left
    off but that way, a line number of 2 goes to the second line, which is more
    natural than moving down 2 lines, as a call to forward-line would.  This
    matches up with absolute line numbering, as well.
  test/hibtypes-tests.el (ibtypes::pathname-anchor-line-test):
  test/hmouse-drv-tests.el (hbut-pathname-anchor-line-test,
                            hbut-pathname-line-column-test): Fix relative line
    numbers to match fix for off-by-one error.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (requires): Remove 'kvspec' and 'kcell' which are already
    required by 'kfile'.  Add 'klink' which is missing.
                    (kotl-mode:goto-heading): Add to go to a string heading at
    the beginning of a cell.  Must end with a colon or a newline.
                    (kotl-mode:goto-cell): Handle cell headings and tighten
    idstamp and relative label checks.
  kotl/kcell.el (kcell:parse-cell-ref): Handle cell headings.

* kotl/klink.el (klink:act): Fix doc to reflect that 'start-pos' arg refers
    to the start of the cell-ref in the link, not to the link's referent.
                (klink:at-p): Limit matches to .kotl? files.

* hpath.el (hpath:find):
* kotl/klink.el (link-to-kotl, klink:parse, klink:at-p, klink:replace-label,
    klink:update-label): Support # anchor refs that use cell-refs to kotl files.
  kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:goto-cell-ref): Add for use in kotl anchored
    pathname refs and in 'link-to-kcell' actype.

2023-10-25  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

    (hui--ibut-link-directly-to-dired)

    expected to fail.

* hbut.el (gbut:ebut-key-list): Use hbdata:to-entry-in-file for global
    button file data.

* hbdata.el (hbdata:is-but-data-stored-in-buffer)
    (hbdata:to-entry-in-buffer, hbdata:to-entry-in-file): Refactor into
    three methods to separate out button data stored in a file.
    (hbdata:to-entry-buf): Use new methods.

2023-10-22  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hbut.el (gbut:save-buffer): Add function to use after global button file is
    edited.

    if on a directory or file name.

2023-10-21  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hibtypes.el (markdown-follow-inline-link-p): Fix to process anchored
    path links rather than dropping through to another ibtype since that
    would trigger an error since point would have been moved in order to
    leave it on the path and not the name part of a markdown link.  Remove
    need to move point by calling 'markdown-link-url'.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp-find-tag): Fix that some tags were not found by
    xref because this function turned on xref-etags-mode in Elisp files
    rather than using its elisp backend.  Remove that code.
                (tags-fix): Remove optional load of this very old file.

2023-10-11  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

* test/hui-tests.el (hui-gbut-number-of-gbuts-with-no-buttons)
    (hui-gbut-number-of-gibuts-when-one-button)

    (hui-gbut-number-of-gibuts-from-mail-mode)
    (hui-gbut-number-of-gebuts-from-mail-mode): Verify number of global
    ibuts and ebuts.

2023-10-09  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

* Makefile: Compile each el file in a separate Emacs process so that the
    compilation environment is clean and produces relevant warning
    messages.

2023-10-02  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol--blank-buffer): Add a space in front of buffer
    name so it is hidden from buffer listings.

* test/demo-tests.el (demo-annotated-reference-test):
  test/hmouse-drv-tests.el (hbut-annot-bib-test):
  test/hibtypes-tests.el (ibtypes::annot-bib-test):
  DEMO (Annotated Bibliography Buttons): Remove since won't work when DEMO
    is displayed in 'org-mode'.

* hibtypes.el (annot-bib): Fix doc to mention modes excluded.

* hypb.el (hypb:display-file-with-logo): Temporarily disable use of

  MANIFEST: Format for org-mode display.
  hypb.el (hypb:display-file-with-logo): Add use of 'org-mode' to supplement
    view minor mode.

* hui.el (hui:link-possible-types): When reading a dir or file and not
    on such a string, use the 'default-directory' or 'buffer-file-name'.
    Previously just returned nil in such circumstances.

* hmail.el (hmail:hbdata-to-p): Add 'widen' call when hbdata is in
    the button source buffer and no file is attached, so that it is
    temporarily made visible/searchable.

    Fix to trigger an error if arg is anything but a readable filename.
           (hpath:shorten): Add and use in 'ibut:insert-text'.

* hibtypes.el (pathname-line-and-column): Fix label selection to always
    include whole delimited path.  Previously, only a part of the path
    might flash as a button.

2023-09-18  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* man/hyperbole.texi (Menus):
  hui-mini.el (hui:menu-choose): When on the initial Hy9> prompt of the
    top-level menu and press RET:
      Remove extra call to 'hyperbole-minibuffer-menu'.
      Change so quits the minibuffer menu and leaves Smart Key update
      message in the minibuffer.

  where ibuts are created.

* hui.el (hui:ibut-link-directly): This may be invoked via 'hkey-either'
    which runs the Assist Key when given a single C-u prefix argument.
    In such a case, don't use the prefix argument as a flag to prompt
    for the ibutton name as we want to just insert the appropriate ibut

    found a matching ibut at point.  If point is in front of the text
    delimiter and no name, don't move point.

          (ibut:rename): Clear any in-memory current button attributes so
    cannot reference any invalid buffer locations after rename.  Also, improve

* hbut.el (ibut:create): Comment out clear of 'hbut:current attributes to prevent

    label to flash in this ibtype.

* hui.el (hui:hbut-operate): Fix so point is temporarily moved to the start of the button

  test/smart-org-tests.el (smart-org-mode-with-smart-keys-buttons-on-hypb-button-activates)

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:self-insert-command): Remove special kotl-mode auto-filling
    is handled by regular 'self-insert-command'.  This fixes improper hanging indent auto-
    filling in kcells due to narrowing kcell to text contents only, hiding the cell prefix.
                    (kotl-mode:pre-self-insert-command):
  kotl/kotl-orgtbl.el (kotl-mode:setup-overriding-orgtbl-keymap): Remove reference to
    'kotl-mode:self-insert-command'.

2023-08-06  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hbut.el (ibut:create): Fix to move point inside the delimited text of an ibut rather than just
    outside.
          (ibut:set-name-and-label-key-p): Make interactive so can call and have 'hbut:current
    attributes displayed.

* hargs.el (hargs:iform-extensions-vector): Fix kcell read to not use a completion collection
    but just a type.

* hargs.el (hargs:reading-symbol): Remove, not needed, use 'hargs:reading-type'.

    with prior Hyperbole versions but since V8, instructions have been to add that to personal
    init.  Remove it as loading an Elisp file should not enable a minor mode.

* hargs.el (hargs:make-iform-vector): Move saving of prev `hargs:reading-type' to here so does
    not have to be done in multiple places elsewhere.
           (hargs:iform-extensions-vector, hargs:iform-extensions-vector, hargs:iform-read):
    Remove saving of prev `hargs:reading-type' here.

    restore 'hargs:reading-symbol' value after 'unwind-protect' code block runs for Info-node
    and Info-index-item.  Should be 'hargs:reading-type' instead and this is handled
    automatically by 'hargs:iform-read'.

    menu reading.

* hactypes.el (link-to-kcell, link-to-mail): Fix interactive call with Hyperbole extension
    format to use `hargs:iform-read'.

* hargs.el (hargs:at-p):
  kotl/klink.el (klink:create): Fix storage of button source buffer default-directory since

* hyperbole.el (hyperb:init): Fix potential unbound use of vertico-mouse-mode.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:next-line, kotl-mode:previous-line): Fix that moving from
    2nd line to first triggers a begin-of-buffer error and the same at the end of the
    buffer.

* kotl/kfill.el (kfill:forward-line): Fix to report number of lines left to move relative
    to N.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-tags-display): Replace obsolete 'find-tag' call with
    'xref-find-definitions'.

* hargs.el (hargs:at-p): FIX: Ensure 'vertico-mouse--index' is fboundp before calling it.
    Also fix to return whole string rather than the empty string when point is at the
    end of the minibuffer.
           (hargs:select-p): Clarify potential use of 'value' argument in doc str.
    Also fix so during completion, minibuffer contents are not used unless they match
    a valid completion or are empty and default can be used.
	   (hargs:match-p): Add for when vertico.el is not available and use in
    `hargs:select-p'.

* hmouse-drv.el (action-key, action-key-internal): FIX: Set 'action-key-depressed-flag'
    to t when executing keyboard action-key actions.
                (assist-key, assist-key-internal): FIX: Set 'assist-key-depressed-flag'
    to t when executing keyboard assist-key actions.

* hsys-org.el (hsys-org-global-cycle, hsys-org-cycle): FIX: Temp move point to beginning
    of heading so TAB invocations cycle through all states properly.

2023-07-24  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

* Makefile (install-elpaca):
  install-test/MANIFEST:
  install-test/elpaca/.emacs: Add elpaca install test.

2023-07-22  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hargs.el (hargs:at-p): Make Action Keyboard Key behave the same as the Action Mouse
    Key when in the minibuffer, deleting any characters to the right of point.

2023-07-17  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hypb-ert.el (require): Wrap 'eval-and-compile' call around this to force require
    of "hbut" which defines 'defal' and prevents compilation error when "hibtypes"
    tries to load this.

2023-07-14  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

* test/hmouse-drv-tests.el (hbut-pathname-line-test)
    (hbut-pathname-line-test-duplicate):  Add tests for pathname with line
    number specification.

2023-07-13  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

    anchor.

2023-07-11  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

* Makefile (version, $(pkg_parent)/hyperbole-$(HYPB_VERSION).tar): Do not
    include hyperbole-el.pkg. It is generated by elpa and not needed for a

* hactypes.el (link-to-org-id, link-to-org-id-marker): Do not quote as
    functions they are defact and not understood as functions by the byte
    compiler.

2023-07-09  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hbut.el (ibut:delimit): Add name separator after delimiting name if not already
    there but ensure point stays at end of the delimited name.
          (ibut:operate): Update doc string with caller responsibilities.
	  (ibut:program): Fix to send 'edit-flag' to 'ibut:operate' call when point
    is on an existing ibutton.  Remove 'cannot nest error' since 'ibut:operate' will
    now modify the existing ibutton.
          (ibut:insert-text): Don't insert name separator if looking at one in the buffer.
	  (ibut:operate): Fix to not trigger an error when adding a name to an ibut

    so that any test's message is displayed after an hypb-ert test case run.
              (hypb-ert): Change 'ert' calls to use 'hypb-ert' and centralize
    'message' function override when possible to deal with different 'ert'
    calling conventions in different Emacs versions.

    ibut:operate to conform to all tests.

    buffer start.

2023-07-08  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* test/demo-tests.el (demo-implicit-button-action-button-boolean-function-call-test):
    Rename to 'demo-implicit-button-action-button-display-boolean-test' so can
    find when search for use of 'display-boolean'.

* hactypes.el (display-boolean): Improve clarity of output message.
  test/hactypes-tests.el (display-boolean-true-test, display-boolean-false-test):
    Update to new output message format.

* hpath.el (hpath:absolute-arguments): Fix to process only string arguments.

* hibtypes.el (action): Fix 'args' not being set right after add display-* actypes.
    Stop storing unneeded ibutton 'action attribute.

* hact.el (actype:action): Fix doc to say may return actype's fboundp symbol.
    Use 'actype:action-body' if always need the body of the function.
          (symtable:actype-p): Fix to return Elisp function symbols as well
    since 'actype:elisp-symbol' is an alias to this defsubst.
          (symtable:hyperbole-actype-p): Add to exclude Elisp function symbols.
          (actype:act): Use above new function.

    to allow for opening pair chars after matching anchor (previously had to be a
    :punct: character only).

2023-07-04  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyperbole.el (hyperb:init): Activate 'vertico-mouse-mode' when
    'vertico-mode' is used so that the Action Key properly selects completions
    from the candidate list.  Since Vertico displays completions automatically,
    must initialize this before Vertico is invoked so cannot wait until a Smart
    Mouse Key is first pressed.
  hargs.el (hargs:select-p):
           (hargs:at-p): When 'hargs:reading-type' is nil, rather than a
    string, return a list of (completion-so-far exact-completion-match),
    for consumption by 'hargs:select-p'.  Add feature to kill to end of
    minibuffer line and refresh completions when not inserting a fully
    matching completion (works for regular and vertico completions if
    'vertico-mouse-mode' has been enabled prior to using).

* hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-posn-set-point): Avoid setting point to a read-only
    location when vertico-mode is active.

2023-07-03  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

           (hargs:at-p): Add vertico support.
  hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Remove ivy support; move above.

* hact.el (actype:act): Fix error when 'args' are null.

* hbut.el (hbut:action): Fix error when 'atype' is not a symbol.

* hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-drag-region): Disable Hyperbole-specific functionality
    when hyperbole-mode is nil.

  hbut.el (ibut:program): Prevent from creating a new ibut within a named
    or labeled Hyperbole button.

* hui.el (hui:ibut-create): Call (hattr:clear 'hbut:current) before creating
    in-memory button.

* hib-social.el (hibtypes-social-default-service): Pluralize defgroup name to
    'hyperbole-buttons' to match other files.  Remove duplicate unneeded
    :group from each defcustom.

2023-07-01  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui.el (hui:link-possible-types): If in a .texi but not within a node, don't
    raise error, just use a link-to-file-line instead.

* hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu):
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus): Add Link item calling 'hui:gbut-link-directly'.
  man/hyperbole.texi (Global Buttons): Add doc for new Gbut/Link item.
  hui.el (hui:gbut-link-directly): Add to create named global link buttons based on
    current windows.
         (hui:gbut-create): Update to prompt for ibut name when called interactively.
    Also, prompt if 'lbl' arg is nil and prompt for ibut text when called with a
    prefix argument, 'ibut-flag'.  Also check that start and end buffers are the same
    when creating an ibut.
         (hui:ebut-edit, hui:gbut-edit, hui:hbut-label): Fix to not allow blank labels.
         (hui:ebut-link-directly, hui:ibut-link-directly): In body, clear Smart Key
    variables if not called interactively (since interactive clause also clears these
    variables).  Also, if a button already exists at point, return t else nil.  This
    lets the caller know what type of create/edit msg to display.  If not editing
    an existing button, when prompting for a name or label, use any active and
    highlighted region as the name or label.

2023-07-01  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

* hyperbole.el: Preload `kotl-autoloads`.  Submitted by Stefan
    Monnier. Thanks Stefan.
    Align header fields consistently with other files.

2023-06-30  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-window-link): Move action/assist-key-clear-varriables
    calls into hui:*but-link-directly calls so happens every time they are
    called.

    a variable.

2023-06-29  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

* hyrolo.el: Remove redundant `:group` args.  Remove obsolete `*` in
    `defcustom` docstrings. Contribution from Stefan Monnier. Thanks Stefan.

    a regexp 'string-match-p' to a string input rather than a 'member' test
    to a list of lists.

2023-06-25  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>
* hbut.el (ibut:to-name, ibut:at-p, ibut:to-text): Remove test call to
    'hbut:outside-comment-p' since ibuts don't have to be within programming
comments.  This fixes ibtype 'hyperbole-run-test-definition' failing to match
and thus action-key not running an ert def when pressed within a test def.

* hibtypes.el (annot-bib): Fix missing check that annot-bib is between square
    brackets.
  hactypes.el (annot-bib): Beep/fail if when search for citation, point ends up

    yet integrating variable check instead of 'hyperb:stack-frame' calls.

* hactypes.el (rfc-toc): Fix wrong 'select-buffer' call by replacing with
    'switch-to-buffer' for permanent return to original buffer.

2023-06-24  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui.el (hui:ibut-link-create): Fix name attribute not getting set when creating a
    new ibutton.  Rename 'but-edit' to 'edit-flag' and always send name arg to
    'ibut:operate' call so that button name attribute is always set when given.
         (hui:ebut-link-directly, hui:ibut-link-directly): Change 'but-edit' to
    'edit-flag'.
  hbut.el (ibut:operate): Add 2nd edit-flag parameter; when non-nil, means modifying
    an existing ibut at point.

    new Ebut/Link command.
                     (By Dragging): Move to after By Menu and add paragraph similar
    to Ibut one.
                     (By Link): Add this as a separate subsection.

2023-06-21  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

                (kview:first-invisible-point, kview:first-visible-point,
                 kview:previous-visible-point):
  kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:eolp, kotl-mode:eolp, kotl-mode:to-visible-position):

  hui.el (hui:ebut-link-directly, hui:ibut-link-directly): Add hmouse-pulse-line
    to highlight referent line linked to.

2023-06-21  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

* Makefile (LOAD_EL): Use gnu make pattern substitution.

2023-06-19  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hactypes.el: (link-to-regexp-match): Replace 'find-file-noselect' with
    'hpath:find-noselect' so relative Elisp paths are resolved properly.

* hbut.el (ibut:insert-text): Add 'actypes::link-to-string-match' support.

* hpath.el (hpath:substitute-var-name): Remove matching path rather than adding the
     variable to the path when the variable is one for Elisp files.  These can be
     resolved without the variable being included in the path.

* hui.el (hui:ebut-link-directly, hui:ibut-link-directly): Fix so does not use
    Smart Key depress/release windows when called interactively.
         (hui.el (hui:ibut-link-directly): With prefix arg, name-arg-flag, prompt
    for a name for the ibut and insert it.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Implicit Buttons): Document the Ibut menu changes below.
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus): In Ibut menu, add Link which runs 'hui:ebut-link-directly'.
                           In Ibut menu, rename Label to Name and add Link which
    runs 'hui:ibut-link-directly'.
                           Change all doc string tense from 'Displays' to 'Display'.
  hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu): Do the same as above for pulldown Explicit-Button
    and Implicit-Button menus.

    ever used in 'hmouse-choose-windows' call.  Make an autoload.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-emacs-lisp-mode-p): Change 'string-match' to 'string-match-p'
    since don't use match groupings.

    last cond clause.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:add-cell): Fix that when inserting a child cell in
    a tree with hidden/collapsed cells, 'kcell-view:forward' was called
    with a 't arg that skipped over invisible cells, moving to the end of a tree
    rather than just the next invisible cell.  This made 'klabel-type:update-labels'
    miss updating all the invisible cells after the insertion point.

* kotl/kview.el (kview:outline-regexp): Fix that 'kview:default-label-separator'
    was not regexp-quoted here, leading to false label matches at the beginnings
    of lines and wrong computation of the location of the start of cells.  Somehow
    this fix was lost from when applied before on 2022-08-20.
                (kcell-view:to-label-end): Fix to use 'kview:outline-regexp' only
    after failing to find a 'kcell property to mark end of label since this can
    lead to false matches that move cursor improperly at times, i.e. when a line
    of text starts with a label-matching pattern, e.g. '3a.'

         (hui:ibut-link-directly): Fix was using Action windows instead of
    Assist.

* FAST-DEMO (Introductory Videos): Add video snippets of Hyperbole Overview
    talk in first table so users can see and hear about Hyperbole in couple
    minute bursts.

    Key handling.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-alist-add-window-handlers): Separate checks of
    dragging items to modeline from dragging within a window when not
    on a modeline with a release on a modeline.  This clarifies the
    context when {C-h A} is used.

* kotl/klink.el (klink:act): Improve doc; update link node label only
    if point is within a koutline.

* hpath.el (hpath:delimited-possible-path): Skip if at end of line since
    paths cannot span lines and therefore cannot be within one.

    errors can be seen with tracebacks.

* hargs.el (hargs:delimited): Update to handle regexps with match to bol that
    does not move point forward; move forward a char each iteration

* test/hui-tests.el (hui-gibut-create-link-to-file-line,

    merged into 'hbut-tests-ibut-insert-links'.

* test/kotl-mode-tests.el (kotl-mode-move-between-lines)
    (kotl-mode-move-up-to-first-line-shall-message-and-beep)
    (kotl-mode-trying-to-move-down-from-last-line-shall-message-and-beep)
    (kotl-mode-move-down-to-last-line-shall-not-beep)

                (smart-lisp): Optimize to send any previously found tag
    stored in 'hkey-value' to 'smart-lisp-find-tag' call.
                (smart-lisp-at-known-identifier-p): Caches and return any
    identifier found.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key - Identifier Menu Mode):
  hui-mouse.el (smart-imenu-item-at-p): Move to after programming mode
    handlers so don't have to test for any such modes here and so it does
    not override their behaviors.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp-find-tag): Widen buffer, goto tag location
    and return t only when 'hpath:display-buffer' returns non-nil.

* hbut.el (ibut:operate): Improve doc.

2023-05-29  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hact.el (hact): Set 'hbut:current 'actype property from first arg.

* hbut.el (ibut:operate): Improve create/modify error message.
          (ibut:at-p): Change so when given name-key-only arg, returns name
    field as a key, not the text field, lbl-key.  If no name, return nil.

* hactypes.el (link-to-ibut):
  hui.el (hui:ibut-create, hui:ibut-link-create, hui:gibut-create):
  hbut.el (ibut:program, ibut:operate, ibut:to, ibut:to-text): Start

    'lbl-key'.

* hbut.el (ibut:program): Fix/generalize error handling.
          (ibut:create): Fix doc string to reflect return of button
  instance num string or t for first instance or nil for failure, rather
  than returning the button symbol.  See 'hbdata:ibut-instance' for details.

* hibtypes.el (action, annot-bib): Call 'ibut:set-name-and-label-key-p)'
    instead of 'ibut:label-p' so can tell name from label text.

* hbut.el (ibut:operate): Make 2nd arg optional when creating new buttons.

2023-05-28  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

* test/hy-test-helpers.el (hy-delete-file-and-buffer): Add helper that

    'ibut:at-p'.  Use in 'ibut:create'.
  hargs.el (hargs:delimited): Update to include delims when testing with
    'exclude-regexp' flag but return the string without delimiters.  This
    allows ignoring matches to <[str]> when just looking for [str].

    since know we are in kotl-mode now that this is added as a mode-specific
    pre-command hook: (eq major-mode 'kotl-mode).  Also, comment this test
    out since call should not be on the stack since this is a pre-command
    hook: (not (hyperb:stack-frame '(kcell-view:to-label-end))).

2023-05-27  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:setup-keymap): Create this function instead
    of setting up keymap at library load time so that key rebindings occur
    when in kotl-mode with orgtbl-mode active, for example, so keys from it
    that need rebinding are active when kotl-mode-map is setup.  Call from
    'kotl-mode' but runs only when kotl-mode-map is nil.
                    (kotl-mode) Replace local binding of 'minor-mode-alist'
    with 'minor-mode-overriding-map-alist'.

    is outside of a valid outline position.
                      (kotl-mode:eocp): Change to call (kotl-mode:eolp t)
    so does not trigger eoc when at eol but cell is collapsed.
                      (kotl-mode:pre-self-insert-command): Remove unneeded
    second check of whether point is in a valid koutline position and run
    during kotl-mode:*self-insert-command calls.

                     (Creation): Update and clarify that dragging creates only
    explicit link buttons whereas the Ebut/Create menu item creates any type.
                     (Implicit Buttons): Add doc for Ibut/Rename and document
    implicit link creation via an Assist Mouse Key drag between windows.

2023-05-21  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:yank-pop): Fix: change "\\0" to proper "\\&".

    to "Displaying Items via Drags and Moving Buffers".
  man/hyperbole.texi (Displaying File and Buffer Items): Rename to "Displaying
    Items".

* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Move . operator to beginning of line for font lock
    support and add missing . in gnus modes.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-mouse-help): Ensure call to hkey-help clears both Action
    and Assist Key variables, so mouse key help always works.

* man/hkey-help.txt:
  FAST-DEMO (Implicit Buttons):
  DEMO (Implicit Buttons, Creation via Dragging, Creation via Ace Window): Update
    to describe implicit button creation via drags.
  hui-window.el (hmouse-alist): Make change to long-time Assist Mouse Key drag
    between windows behavior.  Assist Mouse Key drag from an item to another
    window now displays the item in the release window, just as the Action Key
    does.  Prior to Hyperbole V9, this would swap window buffers.

* hmouse-key.el (hmouse-update-smart-keys): Ensure reload "hui-window" library
    so 'hmouse-alist' is redefined.

* hsys-org.el (hsys-org-search-internal-link-p)
               hsys-org-search-radio-target-link-p): Replace 'org-show-context'
    with newer 'org-fold-show-context' and alias this when necessary.
              (hsys-org-radio-target-link-at-p): Remove test of
    (hsys-org-link-at-p) since does not have link delimiters and already verified
    uses link-face.

* hactypes.el (link-to-ibut): Remove save-excursion and save-restriction calls
    so if ilink refers to an ibut in a different file, point is left there
    before the action is invoked.  Fixes ilinks like: <ilink:bs: /tmp/a.org>

* hsys-org.el (hsys-org-link-at-p): Suppress display of *Warnings* backtrace.

2023-05-20  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

          (ibut:create): If categ arg is not given and ibtype is found
    from the given button, use that.  Otherwise, set to 'implicit.

* kotl/klink.el (klink:at-p): Ignore <[ibut name]> and msg attachments like
    <#part ...>.

* hsys-org.el (hsys-org-link-at-p): Stop using (org-in-regexp org-link-any-re nil t)

    Warning (comp): hbut.el:224:10: Warning: reference to free variable...

* hbut.el (ibut:insert-text): Add actype:elisp-symbol call to ensure all actype symbols
    are expanded to Hyperbole internal namespace.  This fixes some link-to-rfc tests.

* hui.el (hui:ibut-create): Add name property from label to ibut.

* hpath.el (hpath:find): Simplify and fix so noselect argument is always handled
    properly and findable path is used in places instead of pathname.
    This fixes an issue with ilinks that include a pathname where hpath:find
    was switching the current buffer improperly.
           (hpath:display-buffer-alist, hpath:display-where-alist): Fix
    'other-frame-one-window' option to return found buffer by adding a 'prog1'
    call.
  hbut.el (hbut:funcall): Update to use '(current-buffer)' when both buffer
    and key-src args are null.
  hbut.el (ebut:to, ibut:to, ibut:to-name, ibut:to-text):
    Send (current-buffer) as _buffer arg to hbut:funcall so does not try to use
     _key-src arg and end up in the wrong buffer.

* hui-mouse.el (smart-imenu-item-at-p): Fix so only returns non-nil
    when smart-menu-item-p call is non-nil.  Stops from triggering
    when not on an imenu item.

2023-05-20  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

* test/MANIFEST: Add missing hargs-tests.el.

2023-05-19  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hsys-org.el (hsys-org-todo-occur): Add.

    matching the path suffix is found.  Any variable added is resolved only if the path
    then points to an existing, readable file.

    variables are utilized for absolute expansions.

    one, then indent will show as 1 or 2 chars longer.

* Makefile (test-all): When run under Emacs with TERM=dumb, set term
    to vt100 so tests will at least run and show whether all ran

    when point is within the ibut.

* hui.el (hui:link-possible-types): Fix to properly get lbl-key for link-to
    Hyperbole button types.  This resolves a problem when using drags or ace-window

    (hbmap:dir-add): Fix via use of backquote to pass dir-name to progn lexically.

* hui-mouse.el (smart-org): Stop handling Hyperbole buttons here and just fall though,
    so hkey-help shows the help for the button rather than for smart-org.

    only skipping past an optional name, if any, not skipping past the text itself.
          (hbut:act): Use with-current-buffer instead of set-buffer to move
    point so current-buffer setting does not leak outside this function.  Also
    reset original point in any active window displaying the original buffer
    to ensure point does not move if the action took place in another buffer.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-x-coord, hmouse-y-coord): Pass 'args' lexically rather

2021-05-02  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* Update release number to 8.0.0pre (pre-release) as not all the
    documentation is finished yet.

* INSTALL:
  man/hyperbole.texi: Made Installation subsections for Stable Release
    Installation and Git Pre-release Installation with the Straight
    package manager.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-tags-display): Fix to never prompt for a tag
    table if none are found from automatic searches.  This prevents
    prompting when the Action Key is pressed on a potential identifier
    that could be anything.

2021-05-02  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

* test/hib-org-tests.el

    ibtypes so does not interfere.
              (grep-msg): Stop from matching to any file names
    that start with quote marks.  Those are handled elsewhere.

* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist, smart-org): Add smart-org near the top to
    handle M-RET dispatching in Org mode prior to most other contexts.
    Also integrated assist key handling from hsys-org.el org-mode:help
    into smart-org.
  hibtypes.el (org-mode): Remove this ibtype; replace with smart-org
    function; this also ensures that pathnames within org links are
    handled by Org commands.
  hib-org.el: Move remaining action types to hsys-org.el and delete
    this file.
  test/hib-org-tests.el: Rename to test/smart-org-tests.el.

    EOL handling and use in smart-org.  Also when hsys-org-enable-smart-keys
    is 'buttons, follow Org links and radio targets.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:kill-whole-line): Add override
    of kill-whole-line for Koutliner.

* hibtypes.el (debugger-source, hib-python-traceback, python-tb-previous-line):
    Separated handling moving back a line to handle 2 line Python
    error/traceback entries into a function and an additional ibtype.
    This eliminates an expensive recursive call to hbut:at-p.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp): When search for an Elisp identifier,
    enable the xref etags backend to find symbols not yet loaded
    into Emacs.
                (smart-tags-display): Use case-insensitive tags
    lookup since this should be true for most languages in use
    today.  Also, make find-tag calls use only exact identifier
    matches, not partial matches.
                (smart-lisp): Remove (smart-emacs-lisp-mode-p)
    check since hkey-alist predicate has checked this already.

2021-05-01  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hibtypes.el (pathname): Update to treat "-simple" as an Elisp
    library to load only if such a library exists; otherwise,
    is not treated as a pathname.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode, kotl-mode:pre-self-insert-command):
    Update kotl-mode to add this new function as a pre-command-hook
    to prevent Koutline editing with point in an invalid location,
    after a mouse-set-point outside of editable bounds (which could
    corrupt the Koutline structure).

* kotl/kview.el (kview:valid-position-p, kcell-view:previous-kcell):
    Handle when mouse has moved point to a non-editable location at
    the end of a Koutline.

* hpath.el (hpath:auto-variable-alist): Add doc summarizing valid
    values of the cdr of each pair, the path variable.

* ChangeLog: Renamed this file from Changes so change-log-mode will
    be used (now that Elpa release builds no longer overwrite files
    named ChangeLog with git log information).

* hypb-ert.el (hypb-ert-sym, hypb-ert-sel): Change 2nd args to
    strings to fix Emacs 27 byte-compile error.

    minor-mode from emulation-mode-map-alists.
               (hkey-initialize): Remove Hyperbole-specific C-h
    and C-c prefix maps and use of the corresponding global prefix
    maps as parent keymaps for hyperbole-mode.  define-key does
    the right thing for minor modes without any of this.
               (hkey-help-set-key): Remove, not needed.

* hbut.el (defal, defil): Added to allow non-programmers who understand
    simple regular expressions to create their own implicit button types.

    ibtype:create-action-link-type is an alias for defal which creates
    a new action button link type given a type symbol/name and a regular
    expression that resolves into a key series, URL or path to display.

    ibtype:create-regexp-link-type is an alias for defil; it behaves just

    button text matching regexp and a link substitution regexp, allowing
    for more complex regexp substitution, not just the simpler action
    button formats.

           (hpath:substitute-var-name, hpath:is-p,
            hpath:substitute-match-value): Used fixedcase arg in
    hypb:replace-match-string calls.

    hpath:substitute-match-value call.

                    (kotl-mode): Automatically enabled orgtbl-mode

    to all of the following (inside Org Table is when orgtbl-mode minor
    mode is active and point is in a table):

     |----------------------------+-----------------------------|

2020-10-11  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* Makefile (EL_KOTL, ELC_COMPILE): Added kotl/kotl-orgtbl.{el,elc}.
  kotl/kotl-orgtbl.el (orgtbl-tab): Added to support Org Table minor-mode use
    in Koutlines.
  kotl/kotl-mode.el (hsys-orgtbl): Required this new library.
                    (kotl-mode-map): Bound M- arrow keys to closely match those
    in Org mode for tree promotion/demotion and moving text lines up and down.

2020-10-10  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (orgtbl-tab): Updated Org minor-mode table use of {TAB} key to
    allow promotion and demotion of koutline trees when given an explicit prefix
    argument.  Otherwise, tabs through and justifies table fields normally.

2020-10-04  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* kotl/kexport.el (kexport:html-replacement-alist): Corrected \\0 with \0 so html
    export works properly.

* hibtypes.el (hsys-www): Moved to lower priority than pathname implicit buttons
    so they can handle file:// links, especially with :line-number suffixes.
    Fixes bug#43794.

* hsys-org.el (hsys-org-mode-p): Added org-agenda-mode check.
  hib-org.el (org-mode): Changed to apply inhibit-hsys-org to org-agenda-mode as well.

* hibtypes.el (hib-debbugs): Raised priority above social and markdown links.
              (org-link-outside-org-mode): Added to lower priority below
    other Hyperbole link types and removed from hsys-org.el.

* hib-org.el: Moved Org mode implicit button and action types to this new
    file to allow for separate handling of Org links outside of Org mode.
  Makefile (EL_COMPILE, ELC_COMPILE): Added hib-org.el{c}.

==============================================================================
V8.0.0 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

2020-09-21  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hversion.el: Released 7.1.3.

2020-09-06  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyperbole.el (hkey-define-key): Added to support help-map being
    somewhere other than C-h.
               (hkey-initialize): Updated to support the above.
  hui-mini.el (hui:menu-doc): Updated to support the above.  Trigger an
    error if the 'hyperbole' command is not bound to a key.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help): Fix to properly reflect and describe mouse
    drags and only reflect mouse usage if last-command-event was a
    mouse event.  Move clearing of action/assist key variables until
    after the last specified action is recorded.

* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key): Improve brace matching by temporarily tagging
    braces with list delimiter syntax.

* hypb.el (hypb:set-raw-syntax-descriptor): Add so can restore saved
    syntax table entries.
          (hypb:get-raw-syntax-descriptor): Add to get raw syntax
    descriptors.  Emacs does not provide these functions.

* hui-window.el (smart-coords-in-window-p): Ensure any window returned is
    still valid and fix eventp condition to return window rather than t.

2020-08-03  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui.el (hui:ebut-delete-op, hui:ibut-delete-op): Display deletion msg
    when used in a key series or kbd macro.

* hbut.el (ibut:delete): Fix to pass key instead of but symbol to ibut:to.

2020-08-02  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hbut.el (hbut:key-src-set-buffer): Fixed explicit button creation in a new
    file that has not yet been saved.

* hib-social.el (git-reference, hibtypes-git-use-magit-flag): Added this flag.
    If Magit is available, when activating a git directory button, use Magit
    rather than Dired.

2020-08-01  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-mini.el (hui:menu-get-keys): Cleared hui:menu-keys to prevent multiple
    calls from concatenating results.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help): Added note that implicit button types are displayed
    in highest priority first order when listing all of them.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key - Helm Mode):
                     (Smart Key - Magit Mode): Added new nodes to document these.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode): Used setq-local to ensure fill-paragraph-function
    is set only for kotl-mode.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help): Fixed to not show 'OR' before first 'CALL' listing
    and to only display Action/Assist Mouse Button contexts when last use was
    ia mouse button and not keyboard.  Also, displayed whether showing mouse or
    keyboard help.

* hmouse-drv.el (hmouse-key-release-window): Required position of last action/assist
     mouse key release event.  This fixed the problem of improperly registering a
     drag to outside of an emacs frame because action/assist-key-release-window was not
     set properly.
                (hmouse-function): Sent action/assist-key-release-position as argument
    to hmouse-key-release-window call.

2020-07-29  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* man/hkey-help.txt: Added magit modes.
  hui-mouse.el (smart-magit, smart-magit-assist): Added.
               (hkey-alist): Added support for magit modes.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:eolp): Added optional 'next-char-visible' arg.
                    (kotl-mode:action-key, kotl-mode:assist-key):
  hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): In kotl-mode, matched to eol only if following
    char is not invisible.  This allows Action Key to expand a tree when point
    is on the ellipsis (invisible portion of tree).

2020-07-28  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode): Set outline-regexp so outline-on-heading-p and
    smart-outline-subtree-hidden-p use it and the Action Key expands cells properly.

* hyperbole.el (outline-invisible-in-p): Fixed to detect if tree is collapsed anywhere.

2020-07-27  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

* hui-dired-sidebar.el: Added support for dired-sidebar.

2020-07-26  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hibtypes.el (hsys-org): Moved org links/refs to near top of priority list so things
    like URLs embeded within Org links are handled by Org, not Hyperbole.
              (markdown-follow-inline-link-p): Fixed to defer in-file links with
    point on the link title to the `pathname' ibtype since
    markdown-follow-link-at-point does not handle them properly.

2020-07-25  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key:execute-special-series): Added and used in kbd-key:act
    to make key series work properly when helm-mode is enabled.  Counsel-mode
    works without any change.

2020-07-23  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui.el (hui:ibut-label-create): Fixed to skip back past opening delimiter
    before adding new label.

2020-07-22  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hsys-org.el (org-mode): Added support for global Org link activation
    (Org links outside of Org buffers) and for Org Agenda item activation.

2020-07-21  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyperbole.el (hkey-global-set-key): Documented.

2020-07-19  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyperbole.el (hyperb:init): Remove WSL abbrev of /mnt/c as /c since may not exist.

2020-07-08  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hbut.el (hbut:delete, ibut:delete): Added.

2020-07-08  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hbut.el (gbut:to): Added to move to a global button file button.

==============================================================================
V7.1.3 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

2020-07-08  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hversion.el: Released 7.1.2.

* hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-drag-region): Added.
               (hmouse-unshifted-setup): Bound down-mouse-1 to hmouse-drag-region to support
    clickable Emacs buttons and proper highlighting when dragging mouse-1.  This also allowed
    for deletion of Info-mode-map mouse-1 bindings.

2020-07-05  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hbut.el (ibut:to): Fix not handling ibut names by substituting ibut:label-p call for ibut:at-p.

* hui-mini.el (hyperbole-set-key): Like global-set-key but binding is a Hyperbole minibuffer key series.
              (hui:menu-keys): Added.
	      (hui:menu-act): Cleared hui:menu-keys.
              (hui:menu-item): Saved hui:menu-keys.
	      (hui:get-keys, hui:menu-get-keys): Added.
  man/hyperbole.texi (Binding Minibuffer Menu Items): Added.


* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key:hyperbole-mini-menu-key-p): Handled empty string properly.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Global Buttons): Documented Delete command.
  hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu): Global-Button/Delete - Added.
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus): Gbut/Delete - Added.
  hui.el (hui:gbut-delete, hui:hbut-delete, hui:ibut-delete-op): Added.
  hui.el (hui:hbut-delete-confirm-flag):
  man/hyperbole.texi (Deletion): Renamed from hui:ebut-delete-confirm-p.
  hbut.el (hbut:delete, ibut:delete, gbut:delete): Add.

2020-07-04  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hbut.el (gbut:to): Added to move to a global button file button.

2020-06-28  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hload-path.el: Used (setq hyperb:dir (file-truename hyperb:dir)) only after Hyperbole paths
    have been added to load-path, so that if they are symlinks, the symlink name rather than
    the truename is used there since the package manage usses the symlink name and may have
    added such a path already.

* hmouse-drv.el (quit-window): Handled primitive functions when replacing this command.

* hypb.el (hypb:function-symbol-replace): Made a no-op if symbol-function is a non-Lisp primitive.
    Also, replace single clause 'if' calls with 'when' or 'unless'.

2020-05-09  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (beginning-of-visual-line,
                     end-of-visual-line,
                     kill-visual-line): Overrode in kotl-mode-map.

2020-03-25  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:yank): Fix hypb:replace-match-string call to use
    a replacement function rather than a string containing "\\0" which doesn't
    work.

2020-03-11  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* kotl/klink.el (require 'kcell): Removed, caused recursive require loop.

2020-03-10  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hbut.el (ibut:label-set): Updated doc to explain that this sets the text of the implicit button
    (which is only its label if there is no optional preceding delimited name).
          (ibut:rename): Changed to only move point to the button but not to edit the buffer when
    old and new labels are the same.

* hui.el (hui:gibut-create): Added to create global implicit buttons.
         (hui:gbut-create): Small improvements; with prefix arg, interactively call hui:gibut-create.
         (hui:gbut-modify): Updated to modify the text of an implicit button and to save the global
    button file after modification if called interactively.

2020-03-09  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hactypes.el (link-to-texinfo-node): Added first param, file, rather than just using the current
    buffer filename.
  hibtypes.el (texinfo-ref): Modified to send nil as first arg to link-to-texinfo-node.

2020-03-08  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui.el (hui:link-possible-types): Added link-to-bookmark, link-to-texinfo-node as possible types.

* hbut.el (ibut:previous-occurrence): Added.

* hibtypes.el (action): Added missing quote in front of variable name arg that caused an error
    on variable name action buttons.

2020-03-01  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hbut.el (require): Fixed require of 'help-mode' instead of 'help'.  This fixed 'make bin' compilation.

==============================================================================
V7.1.2 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

* Published 7.1.1 test release.

* hypb.el (hypb:display-file-with-logo): Modified to not move point or do anything other than use view-mode
    to display the file buffer if it exists prior to this call.  This allows using {C-h h d d} to jump back
    to the same point in the DEMO.  The FILE argument is now required.

* hbut (hbut:syntax-table, hbut:modify-syntax): Added to modify <> and {} syntactic character pairs for use
    with implicit button activations, notably Action and Key Series.
       (ibut:label-p): Used hbut:syntax-table.
       (require): Added elisp-mode for syntax table support.
  hyperbole.el (hyperb:init): Added hbut:modify-syntax call.

* DEMO (Sample Explicit Buttons and Types): Removed email example since it wasn't very good and that
    code has not been  updated in a long time.

* hsettings.el (hyperbole-web-search): Fixed to encode URL special characters including spaces.
    This fixed the 'electric car' explicit button example in the DEMO.

* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key:binding, kbd-key:kbd, kbd-key:parse): Added and used to prevent (kbd) calls from
    improperly parsing "<[td]>" as an Emacs event and as a result removing the angle brackets.

* DEMO (Global Buttons): Added a new example of a labeled global implicit button displaying a todo file.

* hpath.el (hpath:substitute-match-value): Added and called in hpath:substitute-value.  This function
    was hypb:replace-match-string in previous Hyperbole releases but now is only used by this one function.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Glossary):
  hibtypes.el (action):
  hib-kbd.el (kbd-key):
  hbut.el (hbut:max-len): Renamed variable from ebut:max-len since applies to all Hyperbole button types now.
    Increased to 200; allowed for 0 value which means no limit.  Locally set to 0 in Action implicit
    button type.
          (hbut:max-len): Added this inline function to retrieve the proper value.

* hibtypes.el (action):
  hact.el (actype:act): Added support for special forms like: 'progn', 'and', etc.

2020-02-29  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hpath.el (hpath:find): Fixed bug where hpath:to-markup-buffer with point in the source link buffer
    rather than the referent.

* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key:key-series-to-events):
             (kbd-key:normalize): Rewrote and added support for <TAB>, <BS>, C-M-, non-ASCII CONTROL and
    META key codes, keypad keys, function keys, and these modifier keys: CONTROL, ALT, HYPER, META, SUPER
    and SHIFT (when whitespace separated).
             (kbd-key:named-key-list, kbd-key:named-key-regexp, kbd-key:modified-key-regexp): Added and
    used in kbd-key:normalize.
             (kbd-key:key-and-arguments): Updated to handle that key-series now have multi-character modifier
    keys by adding a seq-position call.

* hypb.el (hypb:replace-match-string): Replaced all logic other than error generation with Emacs function,
    replace-regexp-in-string.

2020-02-27  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui.el (hui:ebut-delete-op):
  hactypes.el (link-to-ebut): Fixed ebut:get call to send file as 3rd arg, not 2nd; now link-to-ebuts work.

2020-02-26  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-add): Removed conditional on entry-level-len when nil that was causing an error during
    adding of a record.

==============================================================================
V7.1.1 test release changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

2020-02-23  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* Published 7.1.0 test release.

* hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu): Changed 'Activate-Button-at-Point' to 'Activate-Button-in-Buffer'
    and made prompt for button if not on one.  This synchronizes it with the top-level 'Act' command in
    the Hyperbole minibuffer menu.
* man/hyperbole.texi (Menus): Updated to reflect the above change.
                     (Modeline Clicks and Drags): Added moving frames with bottommost modeline drags.

* hui.el: (hui:ebut-act, hui:ibut-act): Changed body to a call of hui:hbut-operate.
          (hui:hbut-operate): Changed to call actype:act to perform operation.  Also changed to a private
    function.
  hbut.el (hbut:act): Activated only when a valid Hyperbole button symbol is given; improved error checking.

* hbut.el:
  hui.el: Changed doc strings to imperative form.

* hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu): Updated Implicit-Button/Activate (renamed from Activate-at-Point).
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus): Updated Ibut/Act.
  hui.el (hui:ibut-act): Added to better mirror hui:ebut-act and replaced Ibut/Act menu items with this.

* hui.el (hui:hbut-act):
  hbut.el (hbut:act): Added interactive completion of in-buffer ebuts and ibuts.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Questions and Answers): Rewrote Org-mode question a bit to account for
    improved integration.

* hbut.el (ibut:act): Added to interactively prompt for and activate labeled implicit buttons.

2020-02-22  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-em-but.el (after-init-time): Added setting of hyrolo-highlight-face used in HyRolo matches
   so text is highlighted and readable by default (foreground and background colors of matched
   text has been the same for some unknown reason.  This may affect user customizations however.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key - Bookmark Mode): Added.

* hpath.el (hpath:file-line-and-column): Added.
  hactypes.el (link-to-file): Rewrote to use above function, allow for :line:column suffixes and
    trigger error if path argument is invalid.

* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Fixed bookmark-bmenu-mode so Assist Key shows what Action Key does
    rather than generic help.

* hbut.el (ebut:operate): Appended any instance-flag string to the button label; this fixed
    error where point moved to the wrong location when creating a new numbered instance of
    a particular button label.  Also, fixed so any existing text following point or
    highlighted as region is used in button labels, rather than new text being inserted.
          (ebut:delimit): Changed instance-str to instance-flag since not always a string.

2020-02-17  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hpath.el (hpath:mswindows-to-posix): Made '\\' by itself in Windows an invalid path.

* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key:key-series-to-events): Added for use in testing and called from kbd-key:act.

==============================================================================
V7.1.0 test release changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

2020-02-17  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* Published 7.0.9 test release.

* hpath.el (hpath:substitute-value): Updated to handle Texinfo @-quoted $@{hyperb:dir@} variable substitution.

* hypb.el (hypb:replace-match-string): Minor code updates.

2020-02-16  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hibtypes.el (grep-msg): Fixed handling files names with spaces followed by a null character rather than a
    colon as a separator.  Note that the null is set to visibly display as a colon in Emacs.
  hpath.el (hpath:tramp-file-name-regexp): Don't match if a control char is found, notably a null (ASCII 0).
    These can appear in grep expressions where filenames followed by colons may be confused as remote paths.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Swapping Buffers):
  DEMO (Swapping Buffers): Added swapping buffers between frames.
  hycontrol.el (hycontrol-window-swap-buffers): Fixed so current buffer remains the same but selected window
    changes.
               (hycontrol-frame-swap-buffers): Fixed so current buffer remains the same but selected frame
    changes.  Also made this work anytime there are two or more frames regardless of how many windows in each.
               (hycontrol-frames-mode-map):  {~} removed secondary call of hycontrol-window-swap-buffers.
               (hycontrol-windows-mode-map): {~} removed secondary call of hycontrol-frame-swap-buffers.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Renaming, Global Key Bindings):
  hyperbole.el (hkey-initialize):
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus):
  hui-menu.el (hui-menu-key-bindings): Removed {C-c C-r} ebut rename binding since conflicts with bindings
    commonly made in some modes.  Use menu instead or choose a personal binding.

* hui.el (hui:hbut-help): Improved to flash unnamed implicit buttons with lbl-start and lbl-end properties.

* hyperbole.el (hyperb:autoloads-exist-p, hyperb:maybe-generate-autoloads, hyperb:generate-autoloads):
    Added and called from hyperb:init when initializing Hyperbole to generate auto-autoload files when
    running from a non-packaged source download of Hyperbole.

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-quit-frames-mode):
  man/hyperbole.texi (HyControl): Added doc of {q} vs. {Q}.
	       (hycontrol-quit): Renamed from hycontrol-quit-frames-mode.
               (hycontrol-quit-windows-mode): Deleted, created one unified quit command.
	       (hycontrol-abort): Renamed from hycontrol-abort-mode.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-alist-add-window-handlers): Added 'not a modeline depress' test for the
    clause that handles drags from a window to a modeline, since otherwise it will catch drags from a
    modeline that may move a frame.
                (hmouse-drag-p): Added to test whether absolute depress and release positions differ.

* hui-menu.el (hyperbole-menubar-menu): Removed set-menubar-dirty-flag call.
              (hmouse-release-left-edge, hmouse-release-right-edge): Removed XEmacs code.

* man/hkey-help.txt:
  hmouse-drv.el (action-key-depress, assist-key-depress):
  hui-window.el (action-key-modeline, assist-key-modeline):
     Modeline window resizing is now handled in action/assist-key-depress via a call to
     mouse-drag-mode-line, providing live visual feedback.  The same function is also overloaded in
     hmouse-drv.el to allow repositioning frames that have minibuffer windows by dragging from a
     bottommost modeline if the frame has a non-nil 'drag-with-mode-line' parameter.

  man/hyperbole.texi, DEMO (Moving Frames): Added this new section.

2020-02-15  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-unshifted-setup): Disabled `mouse-1-click-follows-link' since it doesn't work
    with Hyperbole's down and up bindings.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-outside-all-windows): Removed errant backquote typo that was causing
    any Action Mouse Key click to create a new frame.

* hargs.el (hargs:iform-read): Removed XEmacs setting and replaced with one-time transient-mark-mode
    setting to keep region enabled when '_' is included in interactive specs.

* DEMO: Removed {} from partial key series that we don't want new automated button tester to activate.

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-windows-grid-by-major-mode): Changed initial-input to default value.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp-bound-symbol-def): Documented.

* hact.el (htype:create): Added definition-name property used by
    find-function-search-for-symbol so now Elisp stack frame and other function
    calls that look like actypes::<action-type> and ibtypes::<implicit-button-type> jump to
    the associated defact and defib definitions.

* hbut.el (htype:create): Generalized definition-name property used for tag lookup on names like,
    ibtypes::grep-msg, which looks for the name used in the defib call, grep-msg.  This had
    previously been done for actypes.

* hpath.el (hpath:posix-to-mswindows-separators):
           (hpath:mswindows-to-posix-separators):
	   (hpath:abbreviate-file-name): Added and called from the above functions.  Same as
    `abbreviate-file-name' but disables tramp-mode.  This prevents improper processing of hargs
     with colons in them, e.g. `actypes::link-to-file'."

* hbut.el (ibut:at-p): Fixed that button category/type was not set if KEY-ONLY flag was given.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help): Fixed listing of command executed when prefixed with a funcall.

* hbut.el (hbut:report): Improved doc string.

* hui.el (hui:ebut-act):
  hsys-org.el (hsys-org-hbut-activate-p):
  hbut.el (hbut:act): Simplified most common call and made hbut optional, defaulting to 'hbut:current.

2020-02-13  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hpath.el (hpath:cache-mswindows-mount-points): If a network share with a domain
    name, also add an entry WITHOUT the  domain name to the mount points table
    since Windows paths often omit the domain.
           (hpath:mswindows-to-posix-separators): Rewrote to better handle
    converting Windows UNC paths to Posix mount points.
           (hpath:directory-expand-alist): Renamed to hpath:posix-mount-point-to-mswindows-alist
           (hpath:mswindows-path-posix-mount-alist): Removed, unused.

2020-02-12  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-verify): Removed check of (stringp hyrolo-match-regexp) since may have
    done a logical search which does not set that regexp.  This resolved an error when
    using {q} to quit from the hyrolo match buffer.

* hyrolo-logic.el (hyrolo-map-logic): Fixed function call.
    Changed: (match-string-no-properties hyrolo-hdr-and-entry-regexp
         To: (match-string-no-properties hyrolo-entry-group-number)

* hsys-org.el (inhibit-hsys-org): Added customization to allow disabling all Smart Key support when in an
    Org mode and documented everywhere.
              (hsys-org-hbut-activate-p): Defined and added to org-metareturn-hook so local binding
    of M-RET in org-mode activates Hyperbole buttons (doesn't run full set of Action Key actions).
    (org-link): Updated to utilize newer org-link-open-from-string function when available.
    (hsys-org-link-at-p): Updated to utilize newer org-link-any-re variable when available.

2020-02-09  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* DEMO (Windows Grid): Used {Q} to ensure quit from HyControl and not from the DEMO (which is in Help mode).

* hypb.el (hypb:mark-object, hypb:object-p): Added these to give strings and symbols a hyperbole property.
  hpath.el (hpath:relative-to, hpath:absolute-to): Ignore any string with a hyperbole property.
    Prevents removal of trailing whitespace from normalized key series, for example.

* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key:hyperbole-mini-menu-key-p): Optimized to compute kbd-key:mini-menu-key only once.
             (kbd-key): Allow for double-quoted key series, i.e. "{C-x o}".

2020-02-08  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key:normalize): Prevent multiple normalizations which can strip desired RET and SPC characters.

* hyrolo-logic.el (hyrolo-map-logic):
                  (hyrolo-kill):
  hyrolo.el (hyrolo-add):
	    (hyrolo-grep-file):
            (hyrolo-to):
            (hyrolo-to-entry-end): Fixed bug that caused addition of new entries at the end of the hyrolo file,
    rather than in sorted order.  Also caused hyrolo-logic functions to fail.
    The issue was that 'hyrolo-hdr-and-entry-regexp' had been updated to include the whitespace following the entry prefix
    and this whitespace was improperly included when computing the hierarchy level of the entry.  Also, changed
    'curr-entry-level' parameter from a string to an integer to reduce length comparisons.
            (hyrolo-r-not): Fixed typo 'path' should be 'pat'.

2020-02-06  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-em-but.el (hproperty:set-face-after-init): Conditionalized settings to avoid overriding customizations.
                (hproperty:item-highlight-color): Fixed initialization error.
                (hproperty:set-flash-color): Ensured not setting to nil values.
                (hproperty:flash-face, hproperty:highlight-face): Converted to defcustom variables.

2020-02-02  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-drag-to, hkey-drag-item):
  hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-item-to-display):
                (hmouse-at-item-p): Fixed to work with ace-window when Action Key is not used.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-throw): Rewrote to throw active (highlighted) region if any.
                (hkey-insert-region): Added.
  hui-window.el (hmouse-pulse-region): Added.

2020-02-01  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-mouse.el (smart-imenu-item-p): Fixed to handle invalid marker positions after buffer changes
    when imenu-auto-rescan is false.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-execute, hkey-help): Simplified with cddr and cadr calls.

2020-01-31  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-em-but.el (hproperty:set-flash-color):
                (hproperty:set-face-after-init): Resolved issue that explicit buttons were not
    being highlighted upon load and that explicit and named implicit buttons were not flashing
    properly when activated due to improper face settings.

2020-01-29  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hpath.el (hpath:markup-link-anchor-regexp): Prevent matches to files like: ".#a.org"

* hui-em-but.el (hproperty:but-flash, hproperty:but-flash-time): Revert this value back to 1000
    since users may have previously customized values that loading Hyperbole does not override.
    Revert logic to using this to compute number of fractional seconds to flash a button.  Prior
    change caused a mistaken wait of 1000 seconds since user customization value was not replaced
    by loading Hyperbole.

2020-01-25  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hactypes.el (link-to-ibut): Handled null 'defaults' when called interactively; needed when
    interactively creating a link-to-ibut and there is no ibut at point.  Also improved
    error message when a link-to-ibut is invalid, i.e. has a null button reference.
  hbut.el (ibut:to): Handled null lbl-key arg.

2020-01-21  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hbut.el (ibut:at-p): Fixed to recognize non-labeled ibuttons in programming modes.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Glossary): Added Action Button, Elink, Ilink, Glink
    definitions to the glossary.

     (hpath:markup-link-anchor-regexp): Allowed for anchor only paths, no pathname.
     (hpath:find): Use buffer-file-name if pathname is empty.
     (hpath:to-markup-anchor): Prevent string-match error if buffer-file-name is null.
  hbut.el (hbut:outside-comment-p): Ignore comment status for html-like markup
    modes that register as programming modes.  This fixes ibuttons not being
    recognized, notably in-file anchor links.

    otherwise, default-directory could be set to a filename.

* hpath.el (hpath:absolute-to): Resolved bug that trimmed whitespace off non-path args,
    e.g. key series, thereby removing trailing C-m keys.

2019-10-06  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Added support for selection of bookmarks from bookmark menu list.

2019-10-05  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

    global button with a link action type.
  man/hyperbole.texi (Action Types): Added link-to-bookmark.

* hpath.el (hpath:cache-mswindows-mount-points): Changed mapcar to mapc since
    not using return value.

* hact.el (htype:delete): Removed improper quote in (fboundp 'sym) call.
          (htype:symbol): Reverted to prior version which properly creates
    previously undefined Elisp symbols, thereby fixing htype:create.
          (actype:create): Made symtable:add call part of compile-time macro value.

2019-09-24  Mats Lidell  <matsl@gnu.org>

* Makefile (ELC_COMPILE): Added missing kprop-em.elc.

2019-09-23  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui.el (hui:link-directly): Called symtable:actype-p replacing invalid
    htype:actype-p call.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-buffer-move): Wrapped (require 'windmove) in eval-and-compile
    to remove a byte-compiler warning.

2019-09-22  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hact.el (action:path-args-rel): Added file-name-directory call so always
    sends a directory as the second argument, preventing off-by-one level
    of relative directory generation.

2019-09-19  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hbut.el (ibtype:def-symbol): Added.

* hact.el (actype:def-symbol): Change mislabeled 'sym-name' to 'name'.

2019-09-18  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui.el (hui:action):
  hui-mini.el (hui:menu-item):
  hibtypes.el (hyp-source):
  hargs.el (hargs:at-p):
  hyrolo-logic.el (hyrolo-map-logic):
  hyrolo.el (hyrolo-grep-file): Undo adding second arg t to prin1-to-string
    call (meant to prevent string properties output) since has side effect
    of removing needed quote marks and changes the way buffers print which
    causes (hyp-source) matches to fail.

* hpath.el (hpath:to-line): Added and used in hpath:find and hpath:find-line.
           (hpath:find-line): Changed to save-restriction when move.
	   (hpath:shell-modes): Added and used in hpath:to-markup-anchor.

2019-09-16  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hpath.el (hpath:line-and-column-regexp): Added.
           (hpath:markup-link-anchor-regexp): Added group number to doc.

    by a link anchor.

2019-09-15  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp-at-tag-p): Ignore any leading '<' character
    from action buttons or other links, i.e. only when followed by an
    alphabetic character.

* hibtypes.el (action): Moved to near highest priority so embedded
    paths or other constructs do not match first.

* hact.el (symset:create): Added.  Can be used to manually test out
    different ibtype activation priorities.

* hibtypes.el (pathname-line-and-column): Moved to higher priority
    than grep, debugger and stack frame matches, so optional col
    number is not ignored.

* hpath.el (hpath:markdown-section-pattern): Added '*' as a section prefix
    and allowed for leading whitespace.

* hbut.el (ibut:at-p): Ignore any invalid null ibtype entries.

* hact.el (htype:category, htype:names): Simplified and speeded up.  Don't
    check existence of types.  Only valid types should be in
    the type category list.

* hbut.el (hattr:report): Changed intern call to make-symbol.

           ibtype:delete, htype:category, htype:delete, htype:symbol):
    Changed to use new, faster symtable instead of symset.

* hact (actype:action): Fixed to handle regular Elisp functions properly.

* set.el: Changed doc strings to imperative form.  Explained in the
    commentary that set:add can create a new single element set if the
    set passed is nil (empty).
         (set:empty): Added to test for emptiness.

* hact.el (symtable): Added to speed checks of whether a symbol is an
    existing Hyperbole type or not.  Created symtable:ibtypes and
    symtable:actypes to hold the categories of types.
* hact.el (actype:obarray): Added and filled in actype:create to speed
    checks of whether a symbol is an actype.

2019-09-13  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hpath.el (hpath:to-markup-anchor): Added buffer-name to error messages as
    may be called when a buffer is temporarily selected.

2019-09-12  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hpath.el (hpath:find): Changed to return buffer if path is displayed
    within a buffer and not externally (used to return t).  Added
    third parameter 'noselect' flag to return a buffer attached
    to the parsed filename but not to display it.
           (hpath:find-noselect): Added.
	   (hpath:normalize): Added and used in link-to-e/ibutton

2019-09-11  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-emacs-lisp-mode-p): Added change-log-mode so
    Elisp symbols there are matched.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp-at-definition-p): Don't match to 'def' alone.

2019-09-10  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hact.el (actype:action-body): Renamed from actype:action.
          (actype:action): Return action function symbol whenever possible

* hargs.el (hargs:reading-p): Updated doc string.

2019-09-02  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hbut.el (ibut:to): Point might be on closing delimiter of ibut in which
   case ibut:label-p returns nil; moved back one character to prevent this.
   Also changed wrong ibut:label-p call to proper ibut:at-p call to
   compare ibut key value at point to search match.

* hpath.el (hpath:substitute-value): Handled case where path does not
    include a directory separator after the variable name since the
    variable itself does, e.g.
    "${hyperb:dir}DEMO#POSIX and MSWindows Paths".  Also works if path
    separator is included.

* hui.el (hui:gbut-create, hui:gbut-modify): Fixed so that when link button paths
    are created, they are normalized and made absolute based upon the
    current buffer's default directory, not the global button file directory.
  hact.el (action:path-args-rel): Prior to button data storage, make absolute
    paths relative to the default-directory of their button file, not the current
    directory.

* hpath.el (hpath:find): Improved default-directory handling.

* hpath.el (hpath:relative-to, hpath:absolute-to):
  hactypes.el (link-to-file, link-to-file-line, link-to-file-line-and-column):
    Remove any double quotes and whitespace at the start and end of the path
    that interactive use or key series may have introduced.
  hactypes.el (link-to-file): Rewrote for use with global buttons where the button
    source directory is different than the link-to directory.  If path is not
    absolute, add its link-to directory to it.

* hibtypes.el, hpath.el: Added require of subr-x for string-trim function.
  hpath.el (hpath:trim): Added.

* hpath.el (hpath:is-p): Fixed failure to expand variables when path contains
     a [#,] suffix.

2019-08-31  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* XEmacs: Removed support since no one uses it anymore.

* hbdata.el (hbdata:build): Fixed bug where int was sent to concat.

* hbut.el (ebut:operate): Fixed bug that caused hui:gbut-create to
    create buttons in the wrong place, sometimes in the middle of
    other buttons.  Added (and (not curr-label) (hmouse-use-region-p)
    calls to fix this.

* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key): Handled long key series up to 3000 characters
    with embedded elisp actions.

* hactypes.el (exec-shell-cmd): Fixed window handling accounting for
    pop-to-buffer call in shell function when shell is newly created.

* DEMO: Added sections on Button Files and Global Buttons.

    Button Types.
                     (Implicit Button Type): Changed to Implicit Button
    Type Creation.

2019-08-26  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hibtypes.el (hlink, parse-label-and-file): Added to allow for linking
    to Hyperbole butttons in other files and used in e/g/ilinks.

* hargs.el (hargs:delimited): Replaced cl evenp call with zerop and modulo.
  hibtypes.el (action): Replaced cl 'find' call with 'string-match-p'.

* Makefile (dev-install): Removed this target and replaced with 'bin'.  Added
   'src' target to setup to run from .el files only.  Updated help to explain
   how to run test code either from .el or .elc files.

==============================================================================
V7.0.5 test release changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

* Makefile (HYPERBOLE_FILES): Removed hyperbole-pkg.el and deleted that file
    which is now auto-generated.

* hactypes.el (exec-window-cmd): BUG FIX: Removed use of InfoDock 'new-shell'
    function which did not support provision of a buffer name for shell
    creation.  Also, called 'shell' command if existing shell buffer does not
    have a process and updated buf-name with the buffer returned by the
    'shell' command.
              (exec-shell-cmd): Applied similar changes.

* hpath.el (hpath:find): Changed modifier comparisons to use = and wrapped
    (load filename) in a 'hact' macro.
    (hpath:is-p): BUG FIX: Only temporarily strip any initial execution modifier
      character from the path so can be handled later by action types.

2019-08-24  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* DEMO (Action Buttons): Added this new section to explain implicit action buttons.

* Merged in doc string change from active to imperative tense and updated

* hactypes.el (display-variable): Added to display Elisp variable values.
  hibtypes.el (action:start, action:end, action): Added to allow in-buffer angle bracket
    delimited action/function calls/variable displays.
  hact.el (actype:act): Simplified logic and added support for printing variable values as an action.
          (actype:eval): Added to support action ibuts.

* hbut.el (hbut:act): Changed to use hrule:action setting.

* hbut.el (defact): Updated doc to reflect that action type functions may not return nil.
    Temporarily set hrule:action to #'actype:eval if you need a potential nil return.
  hactypes.el (eval-elisp): Updated doc-string to reflect it is for its side-effects and cannot
    return a nil value.

2019-08-22  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp-identifier-first-char-regexp, smart-lisp-identifier-chars,

    function to apply to all paths given as inputs.  Expanded doc to explain this normalization.

2019-08-18  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

    notably when displaying @loc> locations.

* hversion.el: Change to using numeric test release codes instead of letters to ease version parsing.

2019-08-16  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hpath.el (hpath:start-end): Added so implicit pathname buttons can flash when activated.

2019-06-12  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key:normalize): Removed aggregation of C-u arguments into something like: C-u(16)

2019-06-11  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hypb.el (hypb:format-quote): Modified to return non-string args as is rather than ignoring them so

2019-06-06  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hpath.el (hpath:find): Removed file-relative-name from error calls
    because does not work when current-directory and filename are on different
    drives under Windows at least through Emacs 26.
           (hpath:find): Fixed that default-directory was not set to current
       button's location, so path was expanded relative to another
       directory, notably in hpath:validate call.

2019-06-05  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hpath.el (hpath:is-p): Tightened remote-path check to prevent matches that end with :line-num or :col-num.

2019-06-04  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

                 (kvspec:show-lines-this-cell): Fixed viewspec 'c0' to expand visible cells properly.

    {M-o i} change.

2019-05-07  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hpath.el (hpath:directory-expand-alist: Added to store the reverse of
    each WSL mount-point for when converting from mswindows-to-posix.  Set

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-jedi-find-file): Added.
		(smart-python-jedi-to-definition-p): Improved to use
    hpath:display-where to display target when possible, i.e. when the
    emacs-jedi project accepts our pull-request that adds this feature.

2019-04-22  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hversion.el: Pushed BW changes for 7.0.2c test update.

* hui-window.el (smart-window-of-coords): Handled null coords parameter.

2019-02-10  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-drag-to): Fixed to match documentation that says will
    create an explicit file link button if called anywhere other than on
    a listing item.

    treemacs-buffer-exists? with new calls to treemacs-current-visibility
    and treemacs-get-local-buffer for Treemacs V2.

* hibtypes.el (ripgrep-msg): Tightened match to ignore empty potential filenames
    that matched when they were expanded to the current directory.

2019-02-05  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp-mode-p): Removed change-log-mode.
    (smart-lisp-at-change-log-tag-p): Added so can match
      only to bound Elisp entities in change-log-mode with '-' in
      the middle of their names to prevent false positives.
  hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Added tightened change-log-mode handling.
   man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key - Lisp Source Code): Documented change.

* hargs.el (hargs:delimited): Fixed that strings on lines with an odd number
    of delimiters might fail to match.  Since strings can span lines but this
    function matches only strings that start on the current line, when
    start-delim and end-delim are the same and there are an odd number of
    delimiters in the search range, assume point is within a
    string and not between two other strings.
    For example, with the following text and point within "DEMO", its path
    previously was not found:
      For each site, the links are properly maintained.  See "DEMO#Path
      suffixes and Variables" and "DEMO#Path Prefixes".  "DEMO"

* hui-treemacs.el: Deleted treemacs-mode from aw-ignored-buffers so can select
    a Treemacs window via ace-window.

2019-02-04  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-mouse.el (smart-dired-assist): Prevented any region selection from
    causing multiple files to be marked for deletion; we want to mark
    only one.

    to show a decent approximation of the button label when displaying help.

2019-02-03  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hversion.el: Pushed BW changes for 7.0.2b test update.

* hui-treemacs.el (treemacs-quit): Defined if treemacs doesn't and used.

* hargs.el (hargs:buffer-substring): Added and used in hargs:delimited to
    replace null char in colored grep output lines with a colon, so they are
    handled properly by the implicit buttons.

2019-01-27  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hversion.el (hyperb:microsoft-os-p): Renamed to this.

* hpath.el (hpath:cache-mswindows-mount-points):
    Added and called when Hyperbole is initialized, mainly to allow access to
    MSWindows network shares which would otherwise not be accessible as links
    under POSIX systems.
           (hypb:map-plist): Added to map over property lists.
    Called in hpath:cache-mswindows-mount-points.

    hpath:substitute-posix-or-mswindows-at-point, hpath:substitute-posix-or-mswindows):
      Added to handle MSWindows paths under POSIX OSes, e.g. Windows Subsystem for Linux.

2017-12-29  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hsettings.el (inhibit-hyperbole-messaging): Moved this from hyperbole.el to here to prevent
    it being reset when hyperbole-toggle-messaging reloads the hyperbole library.

2017-12-20  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* kotl/kexport.el (kexport:html-file-klink)
                  (kexport:html):
                  (kexport:html-replacement-alist): Added 'k' to precede klink HTML HREF

2017-12-15  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-throw): Fully resolved temporary display of newly created frames
    with a (redisplay t) to force display of any window updates during the temporary
    display.

2017-12-13  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-throw): Partially solved temporary display of newly created frames
    (when not given focus initially with a '(no-focus-on-map . t) property), so hkey-throw
    to a new target frame now temporarily displays the target frame and then makes the start
    frame the uppermost frame.  When on an item though, the item is not visible during the
    temporary display yet.

* Makefile (texinfo): Added texinfo dependency target and added additional image dependencies
    in man/im.

* hyperbole.el (require 'hmouse-drv): Changed from hmouse-key to prevent a require cycle
    during macro expansion.
  hmouse-key.el: Changed requires to just be during compile since hyperbole.el now includes
    these requires and will load hmouse-key.

2017-12-12  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hversion.el: Pushed 7.0.2a test update.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-throw): Modified to show a message if the frame of release is
    different than the frame of depress, since this frame is typically hidden by
    the depress frame.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp-mode-p): Added change-log-mode since such files often contain
    Lisp references.

* hypb.el (hypb:select-window-frame): Added and used in hmouse-item-to-window.
          (hypb:save-selected-window-and-input-focus): Added and used in hkey-throw.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode): Fixed setq close paren error that skipped 4 settings of
    paragraph-start, selective-display, selective-display-ellipses and track-eol.

2017-12-10  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* man/hyperbole.texi (Menu Commands, HyRolo Menu): Documented how to invoke the Koutliner and
    HyRolo popup menus in Emacs.

* hyrolo-menu.el (hyrolo-menubar-menu):
  kotl/kmenu.el (kotl-menubar-menu): For GNU Emacs, use standard binding of C-mouse-3 to popup
    mode-specific menu instead of mouse-3.

2017-12-08  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-ace-window-setup): Autoloaded since might be added to an init file
    before Hyperbole is loaded.

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-quit-frames-mode, hycontrol-quit-windows-mode): Added conditionals
    to allow for quitting from help buffers with {q} while remaining in HyControl, e.g. if
    display a key binding help window.  Added {Q} binding to unconditionally quit from HyControl.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-buffer-move): Added directional movement commands that call this function.
    hkey-buffer-move-left, hkey-buffer-move-right, hkey-buffer-move-down and hkey-buffer-move-up.

2017-12-07  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hload-path.el (hyperb:emacs-p): Removed Emacs19 test.
                (hyperb:kotl-p): Removed since all versions of Emacs in use now support the Koutliner.

* hlvar.el - Removed this since colons are now handled by Emacs 26 in local variable names.

* hypb.el (hypb:rgrep): Added support for ripgrep.
  hibtypes.el (ripgrep-msg): Added implicit button support for ripgrep (rg) messages where
    the associated pathname is output once before all matching lines.
    See "https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep".

2017-12-04  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-drv.el (hmouse-alist): Reload the def of this variable if its value is null.
    (hmouse-choose-windows): Added to perform cross-window drags, replacements and throws with 3 mouse
       clicks.

2017-12-03  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-treemacs.el: Removed replacements for treemacs functions; as of Treemacs 1.14, all needed changes are
    included.

2017-12-01  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-drag-stay, hkey-replace): Added for use as ace-window commands.
                (hkey-throw): Rewrote so if not on an item, then throws the current buffer.
    hkey-replace is the inverse, it grabs the specified buffer and places it into the selected
    window ({r} command key for ace-window).  hkey-drag-stay does a drag but leaves point
    in the originally selected window.
                (hmouse-click-to-drag, hmouse-click-to-drag-stay, hmouse-click-to-drag-to)
                 hmouse-click-to-replace, hmouse-click-to-swap, hmouse-click-to-throw): Added to click
    with the mouse twice on two different windows to select the windows using hmouse-choose-windows.
                (hkey-drag, hkey-drag-stay, hkey-drag-to, hkey-replace, hkey-swap, hkey-throw): Added and
    made interactive with ace-window window parameter selection.
                (hkey-buffer-to): Added to copy a buffer from-window to-window, using ace-window
    to select the windows.
                (hkey-swap-buffers): Added to swap buffers between from-window and to-window, using ace-window
    to select the windows.

* hui-treemacs.el (smart-treemacs): Added standard Hyperbole end-of-line scrolling support.

* hui-mouse.el (smart-company-to-definition, smart-company-help): Added to support company completion mode.
  hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-shifted-setup, hmouse-unshifted-setup): Added Action and Assist Key local bindings
    for company-mode for GNU Emacs.

2017-11-30  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* man/hyperbole.texi (Glossary): Added Jedi item with link to its home page.  Added link to the OO-Browser
    home page in its item.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-python-jedi-to-definition-p): Added and called in smart-python to use the Jedi
    package when its server is running.  It jumps to the proper definition of multi-level module
    references definitions, e.g. a.b.c.  Also fixed error where the default action was not jumping to
    a tag definition at point because it was testing that the identifier parameter was non-nil (no
    identifier is sent in such usage).

* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Moved smart-python prior to Imenu for more advanced definition lookups

* hyperbole.el (temp-buffer-show-hook, temp-buffer-show-function): Added Hyperbole hkey-help-show
    function rather than replacing any existing hook values.

2017-11-29  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hibtypes.el (markdown-internal-link): Rewrote (and added support functions) to handle markdown
    infile links properly.  Previous use of markdown-do was removed because that now does things
    other than following links.

2017-11-28  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help-show): Added conditionals to support org-mode org-goto *Org Help* buffer
    properly.

2017-11-27  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-ace-window-setup): Made new ace-window frames (window id = z) inherit the size
    of the prior selected frame; same as HyControl.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-kill-and-yank-region, hmouse-yank-region): Added select-frame-set-input-focus
    in case released in a different frame.

2017-11-26  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-throw): Restored input focus to start-win rather than just making it
    the selected window.
                (hkey-drag-to): Fixed predicate test to call hmouse-at-item-p instead of
    hmouse-drag-item-to-display and set input focus to release-window if dragging an item.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-ace-window-setup): Added deletion of i and t command bindings before
    adding them to aw-dispatch-alist.
                (hkey-throw): Fixed split line code typo here.
  hycontrol.el (hycontrol-frame-offset): Fixed typo.

==============================================================================
V7.0.3 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

2017-11-23  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hversion.el: Released 7.0.2.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-at-item-p): Added to test if on a draggable item.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-throw): Added to throw a drag item to a specific window via the
    ace-window package and the key sequence {M-o t <window-id>}, leaving the original
    source window selected.
* man/hyperbole.texi (Keyboard Drags): Added description of throwing an item.

* hui-mouse.el: Fixed a compilation time problem with when hmouse-alist was defined.

==============================================================================
V7.0.2 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

2017-11-22  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hversion.el: Released 7.0.1.

* hui.el (hui:buf-writable-err): Added previously unused func-name parameter to error msg.

* hypb.el (hypb:error): Fixed issue when a literal string with % characters in it was sent to format
    and triggered an error, e.g. when a buffer or file name contains a %.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help-show): Limited local binding of {q} to hkey-help-hide only
    when in a help-mode (or derived) buffer.

2017-11-21  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* DEMO (Displaying File and Buffer Items): Added description of ace-window integration.

* HY-WHY.kotl: Added link to Delimited Thing drags; mention of Treemacs

* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key - Treemacs): Added and updated with other improvements for this release.
                     (Keyboard Drags): Added this section and documented integration with ace-window package.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-modeline-click): Loosened check to allow a small movement between press and release
    as long as it is less than whatever amount of movement registers a drag (used to require exact pixel match).

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-ace-window-setup): Setup keyboard-based display of items in windows specified by
    short ids.  See its doc string for how to use.
                (hkey-drag, hkey-drag-to): Added for mouse drag emulation via keyboard from a single
    function that uses the selected window point for depress location and the parameter RELEASE-WINDOW
    for the window and its point for release.  hkey-drag-to is useful as a command in the ace-window
    package's aw-dispatch-alist, e.g. {i} for insert item, because it leaves RELEASE-WINDOW selected.

* hui-select.el (hui-select-ignore-quoted-sexp-modes): Added so major modes to ignore for syntactic pair
    selection can be customized.
                (hui-select-at-delimited-thing-p): Changed to not trigger when on an Emacs button.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-between-frames): Replaced calls to window-valid-p with window-live-p.
                (hmouse-drag-window-side, hmouse-drag-between-windows, hmouse-drag-same-window,
		 hmouse-drag-outside-all-windows, hmouse-drag-item-to-display,
		 hmouse-item-to-window): Added window-live-p checks for cases where a window has
    been deleted between depress and release.

* hmouse-drv.el (hmouse-window-at-absolute-pixel-position): Updated to support keyboard drag emulation.
                (hkey-help): Changed hkey-forms to use hmouse-alist instead of hkey-alist so mouse
    drags are accounted for when emulating drags from the keyboard and then invoking {C-h A} for help.
  hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-outside-all-windows): Triggered only if an action/assist-key press has
    occurred, e.g. could be called by hkey-help when no press has occurred.
                (hmouse-x-coord, hmouse-y-coord): Removed error when there is no valid coordinate and
    returned nil instead to support keyboard drag emulation help.

2017-11-20  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-absolute-pixel-position): Added and used in Action/Assist Key functions.
                (hmouse-set-point): Fixed hkey-operate bug by wrapping final (posn-at-point) in
    a list with an event type symbol so if called from a keyboard event, returns a proper format
    event.
                (hkey-operate): Changed so output messages only when called interactively.

* hui-treemacs.el: Added for Smart Key support of the Treemacs file manager.
                   (smart-treemacs): Added.
                   (smart-treemacs-modeline): Added to allow toggling of Treemacs display on
    Action Key clicks on buffer id of modeline.
  hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist, action-key-modeline-buffer-id-function): Added Smart Key treemacs
    package support.
  hui-window.el (action-key-modeline): Updated to call action-key-modeline-buffer-id-function.
  hactypes.el (link-to-buffer-tmp): Added optional 2nd parameter of POINT to display.

2017-11-19  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-window.el (hmouse-item-to-window): Added support for hmouse-drag-item-mode-forms sending
    a sequence of (buffer position) rather than just buffer.
                (hmouse-drag-item-mode-forms): Added support for dragging items from the treemacs
    hierachical file viewer package.

2017-11-17  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-initialize-file-list): Fixed to set hyrolo-file-list.
            (hyrolo-retrieve-google-contacts): Updated to cache Google passphrase whenever Google contacts
    are used so the user is not prompted for his passphrase on every HyRolo search.
  man/hyperbole.texi (HyRolo Settings): Updated Google Contacts settings handling to document this caching.

* man/im/C-hh.png - Added showing Hyperbole mini-buffer menu prefix key binding.

2017-11-16  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hywconfig.el (hywconfig-delete-pop): Fixed bug that removed the ring entry before using it to restore
    the window configuration.

==============================================================================
V7.0.1 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

2017-11-15  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hversion.el: Updated to 7.0.0 for major release.

* smart-clib-sym: Removed file-newer Perl script dependency.
  file-newer: Removed.

* Makefile (help): Removed misplaced double quote characters.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-window-side): Fixed coordinate error when drag release is outside of Emacs.

* hui-mouse.el (smart-helm-assist): Fixed message formatting bugs in hkey-debug message.

* hlvar.el (hack-local-variables): Changed from use of older inhibit-local-variables variable to newer
    (inhibit-local-variables-p) function call.

* Makefile (version): Removed HY-ANNOUNCE-SHORT from distribution.

* kotl/kexport.el (kexport:html): Changed to wrap cell contents in <PRE></PRE> tags if soft-newline-flag is nil
    rather than using <BR> hard newlines, so all cell formatting is preserved.  Also changed NAME attribute to
    ID for HTML5.

2017-11-14  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* kotl/kimport.el (kimport:star-heading): Added and replaced use of hard-coded regexps in star outline importation.
    Also, stopped allowing leading whitespace before outline heading stars so can use indented stars as list items
    rather than outline headings.

* hibtypes.el (text-toc): Expanded file names to include DEMO and TUTORIAL.
  DEMO: Added Table of Contents and a section on using it, Table of Contents Browsing.

* hbut.el (ebut:label-p): Changed last parameter to limit search to two lines rather than one, so Info node matches can
    span two lines as they often do.

* HY-ABOUT: Added link to HY-WHY.kotl.
  HY-WHY.kotl: Added links to relevant DEMO sections throughout.
 DEMO (Koutliner): Updated this section.
  hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu): Added Why-Use? entry.
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus): Added WhyUse entry to display HY-WHY.kotl, list of Hyperbole use cases.
  man/hyperbole.css (code, tt): Removed leading and trailing padding of 5px from code samples so display inline better.

2017-11-13  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-thing): Added error if drag ends within the delimited thing region, so user knows
    that this is an invalid drag.
                (hmouse-yank-region, hmouse-kill-and-yank-region): Made no-op unless hkey-region is non-nil.
    This handles the hmouse-drag-thing case when we want that predicate true (so no other predicate matches)
    but there is no region to copy or kill, e.g. when the release point is within the thing itself.

* hui-select.el (hui-select-delimited-thing): Fixed to match doc and work as a predicate.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-goto-depress-prev-point): Deleted since it duplicated hmouse-goto-region-prev-point.
                (hmouse-goto-region-prev-point): Added missing check for prev-point nil when setting loc.
    This caused the Smart Keys to fail when used if a Lisp backtrace was active.
                (hmouse-drag-thing): Erased any saved location of a region prior to Smart Key depress since
    now we have a new region location.  This prevents hmouse-kill-and-yank-region from jumping to the old
    location.  Also fixed edge cases where want to copy or move thing to the beginning or end of the thing region.
                (hmouse-goto-region-point): Renamed to hmouse-goto-region-prev-point, for clarity.
                (hmouse-kill-and-yank-region, hmouse-kill-region): Used value of point saved in hkey-value to determine
    the region if non-nil.

* hui-select.el (hui-select-delimited-thing, hui-select-thing): Changed to use use-region-p.
  hmouse-drv.el (hmouse-use-region-p): Added and used to improve hmouse-drag-thing.
                (hmouse-save-region): Simplified.
  hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-region-active): Changed call of region-active-p to hmouse-use-region-p.


* hui-window.el (hmouse-kill-and-yank-region): Fixed error that was testing not in depress buffer (as desired) but the
    buffer prior to depress.  Also protected insertion from syntax-directed indentation errors.

* hui-em-but.el
  hui-xe-but.el (hproperty:but-create-on-yank): Added as handler for yank-handled-properties so explicit buttons are
    re-highlighted when yanked after being killed.

2017-11-06  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyrolo-demo.el (hyrolo-demo-quit): Added to unload hyrolo-demo code and used in demo.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Menus): Documented hyperbole-popup-menu.

* hui-menu.el (hyperbole-popup-menu): With a non-nil prefix arg, rebuild the Hyperbole popup menu in case it did
    not initialize properly for any reason.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Using URLs with Find-File): Added URL browser customization menu reference and image.
                     (Smart Key - WWW URLs): Added browse-url-browser-function and Cust/URL-Display reference.
		     (Referent Display): Added this section and documented display options for standard link referents.

* hyrolo-logic.el (hyrolo-map-logic): Removed improper outline test for old format Emacs outlines.
                  (hyrolo-fgrep-logical): Fixed to include sub-entries in logical searches.

* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key:mark-spaces-to-keep): Added to preserve spaces in (), [], or <> delimited sections of
    Hyperbole sequences of brace delimited keys; used this function in kbd-key:normalize.

2017-11-04  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-windows-grid-buffer-list): Replaced all uses of (eq major-mode 'dired-mode) with
    (derived-mode-p 'dired-mode) to generalize.

2017-11-03  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* man/hyperbole.texi (HyRolo Settings): Added Google Contacts set up and use description.

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-file-list-initialize): Made interactive and displayed a message with the resulting list
    if called interactively.  Added autoload.
            (hyrolo-initialize-file-list): Renamed from hyrolo-file-list-initialize.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-split-window): Changed to split selected window parallel to its shortest dimension.

* DEMO: Added new section on HyRolo.
  DEMO-ROLO.otl: Added.
  hyrolo-demo.el: Added with the functions hyrolo-demo-fgrep and hyrolo-demo-fgrep-logical.
  hyrolo-logic.el (hyrolo-map-logic): Fixed issue where a buffer was required but a buffer name was
    given as an argument preventing search from matching.
                  (hyrolo-fgrep-logical): Fixed that logical searches were not forced to case insensitive
    to match hyrolo-fgrep.  Also updated to handle non-logical string searches.

* hbut.el (ebut:operate): Fixed issue where user had selected a region to use as a button label but then
    the same text was inserted when the label was created.  Solved by moving point to the beginning of
    any marked region so buffer text comparison succeeds.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-x-coord, hmouse-y-coord): Simplified logic in GNU Emacs clause.
                (hmouse-emacs-modeline-event-p): If a drag release was to an unselected frame mode-line,
    on click-to-focus systems, the release event will not include the mode-line area when release was on
    the mode-line, so manually compute if that was the location.

2017-11-02  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help): Fixed that arguments were being stripped from action calls in the help
    output.

* hibtypes.el (pathname): Fixed to handle "-subr.elc" whose prefix character "-" tells Hyperbole
    to load, not display subr.elc.  Also handled subr.el.gz compressed source files.

* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key): Prevented matches to brace delimited things that are not preceded by
    whitespace or at the beginning of buffers, e.g. ${variable}.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Implicit Buttons): Added examples.
  hib-kbd.el (kbd-key): Improved doc.

* hibtypes.el (hyp-address): Fixed to grab email address using thing-at-point and work in mail-mode
    not just whatever mode hmail:composer is.
              (Info-node): Added check for ``dual single quotes'' used in Texinfo smart quotes.

* hpath.el (hpath:substitute-value):
           (hpath:substitute-dir): Fixed to handle unbound symbol names.  This fixed an error when an
    environment variable matched a symbol but the symbol was unbound, e.g. (hpath:substitute-value
    "${PATH}/python")

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp-at-definition-p): Fixed to ignore lines like: (default (find-tag--default))
    so the function in that line can be found as a tag.

* HY-NEWS: Updated for next major release

* man/hyperbole.texi (Button Colors): Added doc on hproperty:but-highlight-flag.
                     (Hook Variables): Added doc of: action-key-depress-hook, action-key-release-hook,
    assist-key-depress-hook and assist-key-release-hook.

* hsettings.el (hproperty:but-highlight-flag): Added as a setting.
  hui-em-but.el (hproperty:but-highlight-p): Renamed to hproperty:but-highlight-flag.
                (hproperty:but-emphasize-p): Renamed to hproperty:but-highlight-flag.
  hui-xe-but.el (hproperty:but-highlight-p): Renamed to hproperty:but-highlight-flag.
                (hproperty:but-emphasize-p): Renamed to hproperty:but-highlight-flag.

2017-11-01  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key:special-sequence-p): Added and used in implicit button type kbd-key and kbd-key:act.
             (kbd-key:key-and-arguments): Added to allow for key sequences with interactive arguments and
    added an example in DEMO.

* hui-mini.el (hui:menus):
  hui-menu.el (hui-menu-key-bindings): Added Find Web and Jump Thing key binding change entries.

* hyperbole.el (mouse-position-function): Added this setting to make mouse-position and mouse-pixel-position
    always return the selected frame.

* hsettings.el (helm-allow-mouse): Changed to require Hyperbole-modified branch of Helm named global_mouse
    and set helm-allow-mouse to the proper value of 'global-mouse-bindings.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Version): Updated to 6.0.2g and rebuilt output formats.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-prior-active-region): Changed to call use-region-p rather than active-region-p, for a tighter test.
    This is used as a predicate; fixed bug that moved point, causing Smart Key release logic to use the wrong point.

* hmouse-key.el (hmouse-add-unshifted-smart-keys): Removed GNU Emacs-only dependencies.

* kotl/kotl-autoloads.el: Renamed from kotl/kotl-loaddefs.el to match package autoload naming scheme.

* hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-unshifted-setup): In Info-mode, Emacs uses key-translation-map to link mouse-1 to do whatever
    mouse-2 does but because Hyperbole uses both down and up bindings on mouse2, this does not work.  So we rebind
    mouse-1 and double-mouse-1 in Info mode to be actual Action Mouse Keys (which makes them follow Info
    links/cross-references properly, doing a superset of what they did before).
               (hmouse-posn-set-point): Added to handle frames rather than windows returned by some events; used in
    hmouse-move-point-emacs.

* hui-mouse.el (hmouse-tag): Added require of hmouse-info and hmouse-tag for smart-info, smart-lisp etc. when autoload
    file is not available.

* hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-bind-key-emacs):
  hui-select.el (hui-select-initialize): Added missing double-down-* and triple-down-* bindings.

2017-10-31  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyperbole.el (hyperb:init): Added an "Initializing Hyperbole..." message at the beginning of this function.
    Removed 'Hyperbole loading' message at the beginning of this file since Emacs load function outputs a similar
    message.  Moved Hyperbole 'ready for action' message here rather than at the end of this file since Hyperbole
    initialization may be deferred until after Emacs initializaton time.  Hyperbole init. is complete only after
    this function is run.

2017-10-30  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* man/hyperbole.texi (Glossary): Removed mention of old remote file access packages: ange-ftp and EFS.  Use Tamrp only
    now.
                     (Searching and Summarizing): Renamed from Location.

* hibtypes.el (mail-address): Made lower priority than pathname so when an email-like user@domain is part of a remote
    pathname, this won't trigger.

* hpath.el (hpath:remote-at-p): Fixed to return /ftp: prepended to ftp paths since Tramp requires it.
           (hpath:rfc): Prepended /ftp: to value so tramp recognizes it as a remote file path.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Mouse Key Modifiers):
  hmouse-mod.el: Disabled this feature since it conflicts with present Emacs bindings of Control- and Meta- mouse keys.

* hui-mini.el (Doc/Manifest):
  hui-menu.el (Documentation/Manifest): Changed to use hypb:display-file-with-logo so can quit after viewing.

* hversion.el (id-browse-file): Changed alias from find-file-read-only to view-file.
  hui-mini.el (Doc/SmartKeys): Changed command used to match that used when same doc is displayed with a click at the right
    of a modeline.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Keys): Added section on Smart Mouse Key Drags to match those in the DEMO file.
                     (Global Key Bindings): Replaced hkey-toggle-bindings with proper reference to
    hyperbole-toggle-bindings.
                     (Smart Key Bindings): Included hyperbole-toggle-bindings (toggles keyboard and mouse keys)
    rather than hmouse-toggle-bindings (toggles only mouse keys); moved the latter to the Global Key Bindings appendix.

2017-10-27  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* man/hyperbole.css: Added to format HTML version of the Hyperbole manual like the Hyperbole web page, greatly improving
    its appearance.

* man/hkey-help.txt:
  man/hyperbole.texi (Modeline Clicks and Drags):  Documented new drag below.
  hui-window.el (hmouse-alist): Added context of a drag from a window with a release to a modeline which for Action Mouse
    Key splits the release window (which contains the modeline) and then displays the item or the buffer from the depress
    window in the release window.  With the Assist Mouse Key, just swaps buffers with no new window creation.

                (hmouse-modeline-click): Updated to do full testing for a click, so this can be called at any point
    after Smart Mouse Key release.
                (hmouse-buffer-to-window, hmouse-item-to-window): Added optional boolean new-window parameter to force
    a new window before buffer display.
                (hmouse-split-window): Added.
		(hmouse-modeline-event-p): Fixed conditional error that caused fall through past Modern GNU Emacs clause.
		(action-mouse-key, assist-mouse-key): Set above new variables.
                (action-key, assist-key): Added clear of any value of *-key-depress/release-position.
  hmouse-drv.el (action-key-release-position, assist-key-release-position): Added these to compare to existing
    *-key-depress-position value.

* README.md, HY-ANNOUNCE: Updated for public release.

2017-10-26  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Mouse Drags outside a Window): Added this new section.
    Updated manual with all new drag actions.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-goto-region-point, hmouse-prior-active-region): Rewrote these to work properly so that Smart
    Mouse yanking and killing feature works as documented.  Previously, it was not switching to the buffer of the
    depress point when checking for an active region.

* hmouse-drv.el: Updated doc.

* MANIFEST (topwin): Renamed to topwin.py.

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-windows-grid): Improved doc.

* hyperbole.el (hkey-initialize): Added global {C-c @} binding to hycontrol-windows-grid.
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus): Under cust-keys, added GridOfWindows key change entry.
  hui-menu.el (hui-menu-key-bindings): Added Grid-of-Windows-Key entry.
  man/hyperbole.texi (Global Key Bindings): Documented this binding.

* DEMO (Modeline Mouse Clicks): Added section, "Running Dired on the Current Directory".

* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key - Image Thumbnails): Added this section.
                     Wrapped all images with @example and removed @center so do not appear way to the left of text when
    formatted as html.
                     (Koutliner): Centralized all key binding index entries under "koutliner, ".
		     (Glossary): Added Windows Grid entry.
		     (HyControl): Added Concept Index entries.
		     (Manual Overview): Improved pointer to DEMO.

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-windows-grid-rows-columns): Renamed to hycontrol-make-windows-grid.
               (hycontrol--frames-prompt-format, hycontrol--windows-prompt-format): Changed FRAME: and WINDOW: prompt
    to plural to match mode and variable names.

2017-10-25  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hycontrol.el: Extended initial commentary with new features and improved explanations.
                (hycontrol-split-windows-rows-columns): Modified to temporarily exit HyControl mode if need
    to read a rows-columns argument.
                (hycontrol-split-windows-buffer-list, hycontrol-split-windows, hycontrol-split-windows-by-major-mode
                hycontrol-split-windows-repeatedly, hycontrol-split-windows-rows-columns): Renamed by replacing
    'split-windows' with 'windows-grid'.
                (hycontrol-window-minimize-lines): Previously did not resize window if it could not display all of the
    buffer lines in the window.  Now will resize to 1 line if cannot or if all lines are already displayed.
                (hycontrol-split-windows-buffer-list): Added doc string.

* DEMO (HyControl): Added interactive examples of newest HyControl commands.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-goto-depress-prev-point): Fixed to handle when no prev-point is saved.
                (hmouse-drag-region-active): Return nil if no prev-point saved.

* hpath.el (hpath:is-p): Fixed to handle single % in path argument when sent as format string near the
    end of the function.

* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key:normalize): Quoted % characters as %% to prevent format from treating them specially.
             (kbd-key:hyperbole-hycontrol-key-p): Added to match key sequences within HyControl since
    its prefix arguments are specified without C-u or ESC or META prefixes.
             (kbd-key, kbd-key:act): Used above function here.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-either): Fixed to ignore prefix args set by HyControl.

* hyperbole.el (hkey-initialize):
  hui-menu.el (hui-menu-key-bindings): Changed {C-c \} entry from hycontrol-windows to new hycontrol-enable-windows-mode.

2017-10-24  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* man/hyperbole.texi (Version): Updated to 6.0.2f and rebuilt output formats.

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-universal-arg-digit): Removed first argument and replaced with global hycontrol-arg,
    so could set this value internally.

               (hycontrol-debug): Renamed from hycontrol--debug.  Made public so can be set directly.
               (hycontrol-setup, hycontrol-frames, hycontrol-windows): : Removed debug parameter; no longer needed since
    all events are handled normally by Emacs now.

               (hycontrol-windows-mode-map): [ and ] bindings; don't call these interactively because a prefix arg of 1
    tries to make one window 1 line tall.

               (hycontrol-split-windows-repeatedly): Added to allow rapid visual testing of various window layouts until
    satisfied.

               (hycontrol-post-command-hook): Made this automatically quit from HyControl whenever a minibuffer prompt
    becomes active so can use regular keys to type.

	       (hycontrol-invert-mode-line-flag, hycontrol-invert-mode-line): Added to invert mode-line to emphasize the
    special key bindings in effect in HyControl modes.

2017-10-23  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-split-windows-buffer-list): Added to prefix buffer-list with any marked items
    when in a Dired, Buffer-Menu or iBuffer listing buffer.  If any such items exist, the buffer-list
    is not filtered by hycontrol-display-buffer-predicate-list.

               (hycontrol-pre-command-hook): Added and changed setting of prefix-arg to pre-command-hook.  This set it
    properly for HyControl commands.

               (hycontrol--prompt-format): Added to generalize help prompt handling.
               (hycontrol-post-command-hook): Replaced windows and frames post-command-hook with this one.

               (hycontrol-frames-mode, hycontrol-windows-mode): Made these global minor modes and added their
    variables to the hyperbole-screen group.  Buffer local minor modes renamed to hycontrol-local-*-mode.
               (hycontrol-quit-frames-mode, hycontrol-quit-windows-mode): Changed defs to disable its global
    minor mode.

               (hycontrol-post-command-hook): Fixed so HyControl help messages are not logged to the
    *Messages* buffer.

               (hycontrol-disable-modes): Added.

* set.el (set:create): Added autoload in case is ever used without a require.

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-split-windows, hycontrol-split-windows-rows-columns, hycontrol-split-windows-by-major-mode):
    Incredible new autoloaded commands that split a frame into a number of balanced
    windows specified by rows and columns (typically as prefix arg
    digits).  Each window shows a different buffer, if possible, with the
    by-major-mode command preferring buffers with the specified major mode.  The hycontrol-split-windows
    chooses the by-major-mode command when given a prefix arg of 0; otheriwse, the rows-column one.
               (hycontrol-window-display-buffer, hycontrol-display-buffer-predicate-list)
                hycontrol--invert-display-buffer-predicates): Added to support new commands.
               (require 'set): Added for set:create used in hycontrol-split-windows-by-major-mode.
               (hycontrol-*-mode-map): Bound {@} to hycontrol-split-windows-rows-columns, also in Buffer-menu,
    IBuffer and Dired modes.

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol--initial-which-key-inhibit): Added.
               (hycontrol-end-mode, hycontrol-frames, hycontrol-windows): Used above flag.

	       (hycontrol-setup): Refactored common parts of hycontrol-frames and hycontrol-windows here.
	       (hycontrol-frames-setup, hycontrol-windows-setup): Added and used in
    hycontrol-frames and hycontrol-windows, respectively.

2017-10-22  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* Makefile ($(pkg_dir)/hyperbole-$(HYPB_VERSION).tar): Ensured `topwin.py' script was made executable.
  hmouse-drv.el (hmouse-window-at-absolute-pixel-position): Changed to find `topwin.py' executable in
    hyperb:dir so no additional installation is necessary.

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-window-to-new-frame): Fixed to duplicate prior selected window size properly.

* hui-window.el
  man/hkey-help.txt: Noted that a modeline click on a dired Buffer ID shows the parent directory.

2017-10-20  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-help-flag):
               (hycontrol-toggle-help): Added to allow toggling minibuffer key binding help off.
	       (hycontrol-frames-mode, hycontrol-windows-mode): Made HyControl modes into minor modes.
               (hycontrol-enable-frames-mode, hycontrol-enable-windows-mode): Renamed from
    hycontrol-toggle-to-*-mode.
  man/hyperbole.texi (HyControl): Updated documentation with these changes.

* hbut.el (ibtype:create): Expanded this doc for defact, explaining how actions are connected to its
   'at-p' parameter.

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-abort-mode): Added and used when {C-g} is pressed; exits HyControl
    and executes (keyboard-quit).
               (hycontrol-end-mode, hycontrol-quit-frames-mode, hycontrol-quit-windows-mode,
                hycontrol-toggle-to-frames-mode, hycontrol-toggle-to-windows-mode): Added
    and used as key bindings.
    (hycontrol-exit-mode): Deleted and replaced with above commands.

    (hycontrol-frame-fit-to-screen): Changed to adjust width and height separately which fixed
      a bug in our call to set-frame-size which kept increasing the frame height slightly.

    (hycontrol-frames, hycontrol-windows): Prevented `which-key' package from popping up its key
       help and interferring with the minibuffer message while in HyControl.  Otherwise, the
       which-key help could be left onscreen after a quit of HyControl.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-pulse-flag): Made t the default because timing and display issues with
    pulsing drag items were resolved now.

2017-10-19  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* Makefile (pkg): Changed hyperbole source dir from hyperbole-<version> to hyperbole since that
    is the name of the git repo top-level directory from which packages are now built.

* hui-jmenu.el (hui-menu-hywconfig): Fixed improper variable reference that kept Delete-Name
    and Restore-Name from ever being active.

2017-10-19  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* man/hyperbole.texi (Version): Updated to 6.0.2e and rebuilt output formats.

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-frame-adjust-widths, hycontrol-frame-adjust-heights,
    hycontrol-frame-adjust-widths-full-height, hycontrol-frame-adjust-heights-full-width,
    hycontrol-set-width-percentage-full-height, hycontrol-set-height-percentage-full-width,
    hycontrol-frame-widths-pointer, hycontrol-frame-widths, hycontrol-frame-heights-pointer,
    hycontrol-frame-heights: Added to cycle through resizing height or width of frames to
      common sizes.  Also cycle through one dimension while fixing the other dimension
      at full-screen size.
    (hycontrol--frames-prompt-format): Added {a} and {A} bindings to both frames and windows
        keymaps to adjust frame width and height respectively by cycle through a list of common
        fixed percentages such as 25% and 50%.  Added to Hyperbole manual.

2017-10-18  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-restore-frame-configuration, hycontrol-restore-window-configuration,
                hycontrol-save-configurations, hycontrol-delete-other-frames,
                hycontrol-delete-other-windows, hycontrol-clone-window-to-new-frame
                hycontrol-make-frame): Made interactive.
               (hycontrol-frames, hycontrol-windows): Forced arg to numeric value on entry.
    	       (hycontrol-stay-in-mode, hycontrol-universal-arg-digit,
	        hycontrol--debug, hycontrol--exit-status, hycontrol-arg,
		hycontrol--frames-prompt-format, hycontrol--windows-prompt-format,
		hycontrol-frames-pre-command-hook, hycontrol-windows-pre-command-hook,
		hycontrol-frames-mode-map, hycontrol-windows-mode-map, hycontrol-exit-mode): Added.
	       (hycontrol-prettify-event, hycontrol-handle-event): Removed.

	       (hycontrol-frames, hycontrol-windows): Rewrote HyControl to use a frame-mode
   and window-mode transient keymap which allows for regular key bindings and eliminates
   the need for a HyControl event loop and processing of non-HyControl events.  There should
   be no change in HyControl user-visible behavior from this other than that key bindings
   may now be customized (remember to update the HyControl minibuffer prompts if you do change
   any).  And mouse wheels now work for fast multi-window scrolling.

2017-10-17  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-screen-offset-alist, hycontrol-set-screen-offsets,
                hycontrol-display-screen-offsets):
    Changed ordering of items to match Emacs window-edges and frame-edges.
               (hycontrol-fit-to-screen): Added and used to ensure resized and repositioned
    windows fit on the screen.
               (hycontrol-set-frame-height, hycontrol-set-frame-position, hycontrol-set-frame-size,
                hycontrol-set-frame-width): Added with calls to hycontrol-fit-to-screen.

* man/hyperbole.texi: Removed InfoDock and XEmacs references since they are so old and no
    longer maintained that no one uses them today.

* hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-unshifted-setup): Changed to enable right mouse key as Assist Key unless
    optional argument MIDDLE-KEY-ONLY-FLAG is non-nil (which is how it is called from
    hmouse-shifted-setup).

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-frame-percentage-of-screen): Automatically adjusted out of bounds
    percentages to the closest number of 0 and 0.998 (so does not overflow screen.
    Automatically moved frame if right or bottom edges are offscreen as a result of size change.

* DEMO (Dragging Buffers and Windows): Renamed this from 'Moving Buffers' and added subsections.

2017-10-16  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key Modeline Clicks): Renamed from Smart Key Modeline.  Added
    up-to-date info on click locations and actions.
                     (Implicit Buttons): Added git-reference, git-commit-reference and
    github-reference.
                     (Future Work): Added Direct Manipulation section.
		     (Smart Keys): Moved before Buttons chapter since Buttons references
    Smart Keys and the benefits of Smart Keys are quicker to understand.

* hui-mouse.el (smart-dired, smart-dired-assist): Made end of first line behave just like
    last line for quitting and executing actions.

* hmouse-drv.el (hmouse-window-at-absolute-pixel-position): Further optimized for when
    depress and release windows are the same and frame has an auto-raise property, then we
    know release window was uppermost at the point of release and can skip finding what app
    owned the topmost window.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-dired-readin-hook):
                (hmouse-dired-display-here-mode): Added and used in hmouse-drag-item-mode-forms.
    Once a dired buffer item has been dragged, make next Action Key press on an item display it
    in the same dired window.
  man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key - Dired Mode): Documented here and in smart-dired function.

* man/hkey-help.txt:
  hui-window.el: Updated drag acton summaries with the latest information.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-vertically-within-emacs): Added to allow for modeline vertical drags
    between windows.

* hui-mouse.el (smart-dired-pathname-up-to-point): Added this to change the behavior of smart-dired.
    When on the first line of a Dired buffer where its directory path is shown, treat any ancestor
    subdirectory of the current directory as a selectable path.  Thus, you can run Dired on any
    ancestor subdirectory simply by pressing the Action Key at the end of the subdirectory you want.
    A press on the first / character, runs dired on the root directory.
  man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key - Dired Mode): Updated doc to reflect this change.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-between-frames): Removed from hmouse-alist; treat this context
    the same as a drag between windows within one frame, for consistency.

* hui-menu.el (hui-menu-key-bindings): Added for use as menu filter for
    Hyperbole/Options/Change-Key-Bindings so displayed key bindings are always up-to-date.

* hui-mouse.el (smart-outline-level): Added and used instead of (outline-level) which assumes
    its caller has already generated match data, which is not always the case in Hyperbole.

* hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-move-point-emacs): Added mouse-select-region-move-to-beginning handling
    that appeared in Emacs 26.1 and noted this in the function documentation.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-buffer-to-window): Added along with drag from mode-line to another
    window context to replace the buffer in a dest. window with the buffer from the source
    window.

* hib-debbugs.el (debbugs-query:at-p): eliminated match of #id-number and always required
   'bug' or similar prefix so there is no ambiguity with social references including
   git #commit-number.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help): Updated to handle call-interactively actions and 'or'ed action
    intelligently when printing action documentation.

2017-10-15  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-drv.el (action-key-depress-position, assist-key-depress-position): Added to
    test whether or not last Action Mouse Key event was a mouse click (non-drag event).

2017-10-14  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-drv.el (hmouse-window-at-absolute-pixel-position): Added optional Python script,
    topwin.py, for macOS window-system only.  It determines the topmost application window at
    the given position and returns the application name, so Emacs can tell if its frame is
    obscured by another application or not.
                (hmouse-verify-release-window-flag): Added so can turn off use of the macOS
    Python script when desired since it slows Smart Key action handling at least 1/3 of a
    second.

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-frames): Changed = command call to set-frame-size to use pixel
    dimensions rather than chars/lines for better accuracy.
    (hycontrol-window-to-new-frame): Same.

* hui-menu.el (hui-menu-key-binding-item): Added.

* hmouse-drv.el (hmouse-set-point): Fixed to return a posn object as a fallback, i.e. what
    event-start and event-end return; previously, had returned point as a marker in this case.
    Keyboard-based emulation of mouse drags via hkey-operate had been broken; this fixed it.
* hui-window.el (hmouse-x-coord, hmouse-y-coord): Updated to accept a posn.
                (hmouse-modeline-event-p): Ignored case where args is a posn or point-marker,
    not an event.

2017-10-13  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hversion.el (hyperb:window-sys-term): Emacs set-frame-parameter does not return the value, so
    this function was always returning nil.  Fixed it to return what the doc says it does.

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-frame-at-left-p, hycontrol-frame-at-top-p, hycontrol-frame-at-right-p,
    hycontrol-frame-at-bottom-p): Added.
    (hycontrol-frame-expand-to-*): Rewrote these: first they expand a frame to a particular edge;
      then the next invocation when already at that edge, cuts that frame dimension in half from the
      opposite side (or to any percentage specified as an argument), leaving the particular edge fixed.
      Renamed to hycontrol-frame-resize-to-*.  This allows both rapid expansion and contraction of
      frames with just 4 keys whenever needed.
    (hycontrol-frame-resize-percentage, hycontrol-frame-resize-arg): Added as support functions.
    (hycontrol-frame-edges): Added to ensure outer edges of frames are always used.
    (hycontrol-frames): Added arg as a 0-100 percentage for i,j,k,m commands.
    (hycontrol-windows): Added same c (cycle frame positions), i,j,k,m keys and numeric
       keypad keys to here.
    (hycontrol-frames/windows): Added p (virtual numeric keypad) to allow keyboard-based frame
       quadrant movement when a numeric keypad is not available.  This can be interrupted
       with a q to return to the control menu or a C-g to abort the control menu.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-horizontal-action-drag): Replaced doc typo of 'vertical' with 'horizontal'.

* DEMO (Help buffers): Added description of how to get help for Smart Mouse Key-only events.

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-windows, hycontrol-frames): In window-control mode, changed {f}
    to clone window to new frame without deleting the source window to match similar
    Action Key drag from window/modeline to outside of any Emacs window.  Added {F} to clone but
    delete the source window.  Added these 2 bindings to frame-control mode too.  Documented
    in Hyperbole manual.

    Expanded control help to 4 lines, added = command to equalize sizes of windows/frames,
    added f/F commands.

* hibtypes.el (texinfo-ref): Added doc display for Emacs Lisp @findex (function) and @vindex
   (variable) entries.  Changed so does nothing if function or variable is unbound.
   Updated its doc string and doc in the Hyperbole manual.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help): Changed to print "WHICH WILL:" rather than "WHICH:" when the first
    word of the doc string does not end in an 's', e.g. "Display this" instead of "Displays this".

* hui-window.el (hmouse-release-left-edge): Noted that left edge mode-line clicks must be on the
    first blank character of the mode-line because Emacs overrides the Smart Mouse Key bindings
    immediately after that position.  Noted in Hyperbole manual as well.

* Makefile (version): Added hyperbole.el to version check.
  hyperbole.el: Updated the Commentary with a description of Hyperbole in case the Emacs package
    system or a user looks here for it.

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-clone-window-to-new-frame): Added and used in hmouse-alist.

2017-10-12  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-window-to-frame): Renamed to hycontrol-window-to-new-frame.
               (hycontrol-keep-window-flag): Added: When non-nil (default is nil), leave
    original window when tear off window to another frame.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-emacs-modeline-event-p, hmouse-modeline-event-p): Added.
    (hmouse-modeline-depress, hmouse-modeline-release): Simplified and speeded up for GNU Emacs.
    (action-key-modeline, assist-key-modeline):
  man/hyperbole.texi (Modeline Clicks and Drags): Updated with new modeline buffer id click actions.
  man/hkey-help.txt: Updated with most new drag and click actions.

* hywconfig.el: Changed all (called-interactively-p 'interactive) to (called-interactively-p)
    so will work if called interactively from one of the Smart Key lists.

* DEMO: Fixed a number of small issues with implicit buttons therein.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-diagonally, hmouse-drag-horizontally, hmouse-drag-vertically):
    Added explicit test that press and release are in the same window.
    (hmouse-drag-item-to-display, hmouse-item-to-window): Added dired support.
    (hmouse-pulse-flag): Disabled by default due to sluggishness and improper visuals at times.
    (hmouse-map-modes-to-form, hmouse-drag-item-mode-forms): Added.
    (hmouse-drag-item-to-display, hmouse-item-to-window): Updated to use the new variable,
       hmouse-drag-item-mode-forms so users can add new modes for named item drags.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-between-frames): Added and used in hmouse-alist.
                (hmouse-alist): Added modeline drags between frames and outside of Emacs.
    Added window drags outside of any window (outside of Emacs).
                (hmouse-clone-window-to-frame): Added and used in hmouse-alist.
  man/hkey-help.txt: Updated with latest modeline and between window drag movements.

2017-10-11  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-window-to-frame): Modified in the case of only one window in the frame,
    then clone the window into a new frame.  This allows you to create a bunch of staggered frames
    when in Window Control mode.  Also made this an autoload and called in "hui-window" within
    hmouse-alist.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-outside-all-windows): Added to handle the case where a drag release is
    outside of any Emacs window or frame and used in hmouse-alist.

* hmouse-drv.el (hmouse-vertical-line-spacing): Added and used to compute vertical character positions.
                (hmouse-key-release-window-emacs): Renamed to hmouse-key-release-window and used in
    hmouse-function to set action/assist-key-release-window accurately.
                (hmouse-function): Fixed so action/assist-key-release-prev-point is set properly,
    before point is set to the location of the mouse button release.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-thing): Fixed to handle when release location is outside Emacs and
    end-point is nil.
                (hmouse-drag-same-window): Added and used in horizontal and vertical drag tests.

* hmouse-key.el (hmouse-update-smart-keys): Extended to also re-initialize Smart Key bindings.

* hmouse-drv.el (smart-scroll-up): Removed 's' from the end of verbs in all function comments,
   e.g. scroll window instead of scrolls window, for consistency within the file.
   (hmouse-window-at-absolute-pixel-position, hmouse-window-coordinates): Added to compute the
      actual window and location of the release of a mouse drag which Emacs does not compute.
      Proper top-to-bottom listing of frames is available only in Emacs 26 and above.  For
      prior versions, the ordering of the frames returned is not guaranteed, so the frame
      whose window is returned may not be the uppermost.

   (hmouse-key-release-window-emacs, hmouse-key-release-args-emacs): Updated to use new window
      of release functions.  Now drags between frames work properly.

2017-10-10  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyperbole.el (after-init-time): Added hyperb:init to the end of after-init-hook;
   previously was added at the beginning.  This is intended to ensure that Hyperbole
   key bindings are set after any others, notably {M-RET}.

* hypb.el (hypb:rgrep-command): Changed to zgrep when available to handle compressed source files.

2017-10-09  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hibtypes.el (annot-bib): Eliminated matches for any programming mode (modes derived from `prog-mode').

* README.md: Fixed link markup in Mailing Lists and Ftp and Git Source Code-only Downloads

2017-10-08  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* man/hyperbole.texi (Implicit Buttons): Re-arranged types to reflect newest prioritization.

* hib-social.el (github-reference): Added support for showing status of Github services
    with gh#status.

2017-10-06  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* man/hyperbole.texi (Hiding and Showing): Added paragraph on using {C-x 4 c} to clone
    a Koutline and display multiple views of it.  But commented this out because of an
    Emacs bug which alters the narrowing of indirect buffers after an outline hide or show.

2017-10-06  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* man/hyperbole.texi (Version): Updated to 6.0.2d and rebuilt output formats.

* Makefile (README.md.html): Added build rule as part of 'make doc'.
  README*: Rewrote the Summary intro paragraph and first two numbered items in simpler terms
    for new users.

* hib-social.el (git-commit-reference): Added new implicit button type to display a diff for
    any commit listed in 'git log' output.
                (git-reference): Fixed a few typos and added support for git#=branch:file syntax
    to view (not edit) a file from a specific branch.  Hyperbole finds which project the branch
    and file are associated with if a default is not specified.  Documented in this file and DEMO.

2017-10-05  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hib-social.el (hibtypes-git-build-repos-cache): Fixed to prune matches like 'file-git',
    leaving just .git parent directories.
                (hibtypes-git-find-execute, hibtypes-git-find, git-find-file): Added
    to locate and edit any git-versioned filename.
                (hibtypes-social-regexp, git-reference): Updated with git#=file syntax
    to find git-versioned files by name.
  DEMO (Git (Local) References): Added example of new git#=file implicit button.

2017-10-04  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* man/hyperbole.texi (Version): Updated to 6.0.2c and rebuilt output formats.

* hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-bind-key): Renamed to hmouse-bind-key-emacs since is emacs-only.
               (hmouse-bind-shifted-key): Renamed to hmouse-bind-shifted-key-emacs.

2017-10-03  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-window.el (hmouse-alist): In hmouse-drag-horizontally test, removed check of
   (not (hmouse-drag-between-windows)) since was tested earlier in hmouse-alist.
                (hmouse-resize-window-side, hmouse-release-left-edge,
                 hmouse-swap-buffers, hmouse-swap-windows,
                 hmouse-modeline-resize-window, hmouse-release-right-edge,
                 hmouse-modeline-click, hmouse-modeline-release): Removed optional
    assist-flag arg; used assist-flag free variable instead.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-tags-display): Fixed to include tags-table found in any
    ancestor directory of current directory when tags-table-list already
    contains items.

* hpath.el (hpath:find-program): Changed so Hyperbole external and internal
    file suffix lists are consulted before using standard directory or
    image display methods.  So for example, Emacs.app on macOS, which is actually
    a directory, can be displayed/run externally.
           (hpath:external-display-alist-macos): Added .app suffix.

* hui-jmenu.el (hui-menu-buffer-mode-name): mode-name might not be a string; pass it through
    format-mode-line to ensure it is a string.  Without this, hui-menu-of-buffers could
    trigger an error on some buffers.

2017-10-02  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-window.el (hmouse-pulse-flag): Added to allow disabling visual pulsing in Action Mouse
    Key buffer/file window placement.  Used in hmouse-pulse-buffer and hmouse-pulse-line.

* hload-path.el (stringp): Forced use of hyperb:dir truename (after resolving pathname links).

* hbdata.el (hbdata:build): Modified to ensure that but-sym or hbut:current (if but-sym is nil)
    is updated with all modified button attributes.  This is used after interactive explicit
    button creation or modification to display current attributes.

* hui.el (hui:ebut-operate): Removed as this was obsoleted long ago; use ebut:operate instead.

* hbut.el (ebut:operate): Updated documentation to clarify that this modified button properties,
    notably its action's argument list.
  hbut.el (hattr:copy, hattr:set):
  hpath.el (hpath:substitute-var): Clarified documentation.

* hui.el (hui:ebut-message): Added message for use when creating and modifying explicit buttons.
         (hui:ebut-create, hui:ebut-modify): Called hui:ebut-message after interactively creating
    or modifying an explicit button (just as hui:link-directly already did).
         (hui:link-directly): Modified to call hui:ebut-message.

* hact.el (actype:param-list): Added.
  hui.el (hui:action): Fixed to handle parameter lists with keywords such as &optional.

* hactypes.el (link-to-file): When modifying a link, changed to handle a variable in the pathname
    and also to maintain any prior in-file location as a default when prompting for changes even
    if the linked-to file is not yet loaded in a buffer.

* hact.el (action:params-emacs): Added to use doc strings and autoload functions to get calling
    signatures for Emacs25 byte-coded functions.  Previously, functions with bit-coded integer
    argument parameter placeholders were not supported.
          (action:params): Called action:params-emacs on byte-coded objects.  Also, rewrote
    to handle indirect byte-coded actions as well.

2017-10-01  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-window.el (hmouse-item-to-window): When drag from fixed menu header line, pulse the menu
    buffer and move the menu buffer itself to the drag release window.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Version): Updated to 6.0.2b and rebuilt output formats.

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-handle-event):
               (hycontrol-prettify-event): Fixed to handle large integer code events, e.g. M-p.

2017-09-30  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* man/hyperbole.texi (HyControl):
  hycontrol.el (hycontrol-frames, hycontrol-windows): Removed ESC as a quit command since now that
    key sequences are supported, this is often used as a meta key prefix.  Use {q} to quit.

* hact.el (actype:act, actype:action): Fixed regexp match to beginning of string; quote mark used
   had somehow been changed to the end of string match regexp.  As a result, when explicit
   buttons were being created or modified, no arguments were prompted for.

* hargs.el (hargs:delimited): Removed unneeded properties from any returned string.

* hpath.el (hpath:at-p): Added missing non-exist parameter to hpath:delimited-possible-path call.
    This extends the prior bug fix for hpath:at-p.  See below.

* hmouse-drv.el (hmouse-key-release-args-emacs): Updated to handle cross-frame drags properly
    for when Emacs' event system is fixed to return the proper frame for a cross-frame drag
    release event (as of 25.3, it returns the depress frame rather than the release frame).

2017-09-29  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-prettify-event): Added.

2017-09-28  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hycontrol.el (hycontrol-handle-event): Expanded to handle single non-self-inserting
    keys and key sequences.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Version): Updated to 6.0.2a and rebuilt output formats.

* man/hyperbole.texi (View Specs): Noted that ellipses can no longer be
    turned off.
  kotl/kvspec.el (kvspec:compute): Removed `e' ellipses viewspec because
    it no longer works with modern Emacs outlining.
                 (kvspec:update): Force display of `e' viewspec.
                 (kvspec:activate): Changed to always compute new kvspec:current
    even if requested view-spec seems the same so the 'e' viespec is added if
    not included.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode): Handled removal of newest
    outline-minor-mode mode-line indication for Koutlines.

2017-09-28  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-mouse.el (smart-push-button-help): Added 2nd optional arg, use-mouse-action,
    which if non-nil, displays help for mouse-action property if any, and falls
    back to action property otherwise.
               (hkey-alist): push-button - Changed to use mouse-action if
    last-command-event was a mouse event.  Previously, mouse actions were
     not supported.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp-at-tag-p): Changed to not match anywhere on the first
    line of def constructs.  This aids in using Smart Keys for outline
    folding within Lisp buffers.
                (smart-lisp-at-definition-p): Added to test if point is on
    the first line of a non-alias Lisp definition.
                (smart-lisp-at-load-expression-p): Added to test if point
    is on any type of Lisp library load expression.
                (smart-lisp): Changed call of buffer-substring-no-properties
    to match-string-no-properties.
                (smart-lisp): Fixed regexp matching of require and autoload expressions.
       For require and load, moved point to start of the buffer.
       For autoload, triggered an error if library is found but symbol def is not.

* hui-mouse.el (smart-outline-char-invisible-p): Substituted outline-invisible-p
    call for kproperty:get, which may not yet be defined.
               (smart-outline-subtree-hidden-p): Fixed to match only when point is
    on a heading.
               (smart-imenu-item-at-p): Updated to ignore when smart-lisp-at-definition-p
    or smart-lisp-at-load-expression-p tests are true.
               (hkey-alist): smart-imenu - ignored non-alias identifiers on the
    first line of a Lisp def.

2017-09-27  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-mouse.el (smart-buffer-menu-no-marks): Added and called in smart-buffer-menu.
               (smart-ibuffer-menu-no-marks): Added and called in smart-ibuffer-menu.
    Makes Action Key display the selected buffer in the buffer menu window (like RET does)
    rather than restoring previous window configuration and then displaying buffer.  This
    works better with the new buffer item drag to display in a window feature.

* hui-window.el (pulse): Added require for momentary highlighting of buffer/file
    item lines.
                (hmouse-pulse-line): Added.
                (hmouse-item-to-window): Added pulses to source and dest. lines.

2017-09-26  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-drv.el (action-key-depress): Added action-key-depress-hook.
                (assist-key-depress): Added assist-key-depress-hook.
		(action-mouse-key):   Added action-key-release-hook.
		(assist-mouse-key):   Added assist-key-release-hook.
                (action-key): Added action-key-depress/release-hook.
		(assist-key): Added assist-key-depress/release-hook.
  hui-window.el (action-key-depress-hook): Set to select helm items
    prior to a drag outside the helm buffer window.

* hui-mouse.el (smart-helm-line-has-action): Fixed to use position of
    Action Key depress; this properly selects the item chosen, even when
    a cross-window drag is used; this allows helm buffer and file items to
    be used in Hyperbole drag actions.

* hib-social.el (github-reference): Added support for
    gh#orgs/<org-name>/people query to list users in an org.

* hmouse-drv.el (hmouse-depress-inactive-minibuffer-p): Improved doc and
    changed param name to `event'.
                (action-key-depress-window, assist-key-depress-window):
    Improved doc.

* hui-window.el (smart-coords-in-window-p, smart-window-of-coords,
                 hmouse-inactive-minibuffer-p):
  hmouse-drv.el (hmouse-depress-inactive-minibuffer-p):
  hargs.el (hargs:select-event-window): Updated to handle multiple frames and minibuffers.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-alist): Extended hmouse-drag-between-windows to
    allow dragging items from a buffer menu or file menu buffer to a destination
    window for display.  Helm buffer items are supported as well.
                (hmouse-item-to-window, hmouse-drag-buffer-to-window): Added.
  hui-mouse.el (smart-helm-to-minibuffer): Added to encapsulate when to
    return to minibuffer, and called.

* hversion.el (hyperb:version): Start adding a letter at the end of the version number for
    significant pre-releases published to git, so we know which version is in use.

2017-09-25  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-mini.el (hui:menu-item): Improved so that if menu item has no help string but its action is a
    function with a doc string, then it will use the first line of the action doc string for displaying
    help on the item.

* hmouse-key.el (hmouse-check-action-key, hmouse-check-assist-key): Added to check that both depress
    and release events are set to Smart Mouse Keys.  Mainly for use with helm.  Called from smart-helm
    and smart-helm-assist respectively.

* hui-mouse.el (action-key-error, assist-key-error): Maded explicit these are messages from Hyperbole.
               (smart-helm-at-header): Corrected doc string.
	       (smart-helm-at): Added to test type of helm thing point is at.
	       (smart-helm, smart-helm-assist): Updated to complement each other better; made section header
    clicks work.

* hmouse-key.el (hmouse-add-unshifted-smart-keys): Renamed from hmouse-add-unshifted-keys.
    Made interactive and added error if invoked under something other than GNU Emacs 19 or higher.
                (hmouse-update-smart-keys): Added to provide interactive updating of Smart Keys
      whenever a matching context or action has been changed in the source code; reloads any
      changes to "hui-mouse", "hui-window", "hibtypes" or "hactypes", most notably changes to
      hkey-alist and hmouse-alist.

* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist, smart-outline-char-invisible-p, smart-eolp):
    Added and used to improve and narrow matching of end-of-lines.  Previously, did not handle
    new-style Emacs outlines properly nor helm section header lines.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:action-key, kotl-mode:assist-key):
  hui-mouse.el (smart-outline, smart-outline-assist): Changed to invoke action/assist-key-eol-function
    for end-of-line scrolling, eliminating hard-coded call.
  man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key - Emacs Outline Mode): Documented this change.

* hargs.el (hargs:at-p): Fixed bug when linking to files or directories, would choose
    symbol at Action Key release point rather than the file or directory containing
    that symbol.  This was caused by allowing matches to non-existent files and dirs
    when the 'no-default' argument was t.  Now prevented such matching.  This could
    occur when creating or editing explicit button links.

2017-09-24  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hib-social.el (hibtypes-git-get-locate-command): Added this function to trigger an
    error if locate command is not available when a git-reference is activated.  So
    user knows what happened.

2017-09-23  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hib-debbugs.el (debbugs-version-sufficient-p): Added to eliminate use of version testing
    function from package.el which some people prefer not to load.

2017-09-22  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hib-social.el (hibtypes-git-add-project-to-repos-cache)
                (hibtypes-git-build-or-add-to-repos-cache): Added to allow
    for adding a single new project to the cache.

* hact.el (actype:act): Expand arguments as pathnames only in functions
    defined with defact (actions may be regular defuns as well).

* hib-social.el (github-reference): Added support for listing all active or showing
    individual branches, issues, pull requests and commit tags.  See the
    doc string for this function and the examples in the file commentary.
                (git-reference): Added support for listing all active or showing
    individual branches and commit tags.  See the doc string for this function and
    the examples in the file commentary.
                (defact*): Changed all these to regular functions to
    prevent Hyperbole from trying to expand their arguments as pathnames.

2017-09-21  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-mouse.el (smart-helm): Added: On a source section header, moves to the next source
    section or first if on last.  But this doesn't yet work properly (helm is scrolling
    the buffer and not leaving point in the proper location).

* hui-mini.el (hyperbole): Removed interactive use of prefix argument to set doc-flag and
    help-string-flag parameters since this didn't interactively display doc.  Instead,
    this change lets the prefix arg flow through to any menu commands that can use it.

* hib-social.el: Added full Commentary with implicit link examples.

2017-09-20  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* DEMO (Git References): Added.
  hib-social.el (hibtypes-github-default-project): Renamed from hibtypes-social-github-default-project.
                (hibtypes-github-default-user): Renamed from hibtypes-social-github-default-user.
		(hibtypes-git-default-project): Added.
		(hibtypes-git-*, git-reference): Updated to allow
    git#project/commit-hashtag references.  So now all of the
    following are recognized as local git references if the default
    project setting is set up:
      git#hyperbole/5ae3550    (project name and commit hashtag can be given; commit diff displayed)
      gt#5ae3550               (project default is used; commit diff displayed)
      gt#/hyperbole            (project home directory is displayed)
                (github-reference): Renamed from github-commit-reference.  Also added support for syntax:
      gh#/hyperbole            (project home directory is displayed; uses default user setting)
      gh#/rswgnu/hyperbole     (project home directory is displayed)

    Requires GNU locate for finding all local git repositories.

* hibtypes.el (grep-msg): Added match to context lines produced by 'grep -A<num>'
    which use '-' around the line number rather than ':'.
    (hib-debbugs): Lowered priority below hib-social so it doesn't shadow valid
       social references since its matching is broad.

* hib-social.el (social-reference, hibtypes-social-regexp): Added missing '-'
    character in social-reference matches.

* hui-mouse.el (smart-image-dired-thumbnail, smart-image-dired-thumbnail-assist):
    Added to support browsing of directories of images via thumbnails.
    Action Key displays a scaled version of the original image in an Emacs window.
    Assist Key displays the original image in an external viewer.

2017-09-19  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hib-social.el (hibtypes-social-default-service): Changed to use a radio
    button choice when customizing this.
                (hibtypes-social-hashtag-alist, hibtypes-social-username-alist): Added
    github user and commit lookup via social link syntax.
                (hibtypes-social-github-default-user):
                (hibtypes-social-github-default-project)
                (github-commit-reference): Added this new action and its
    above default values.
                (hibtypes-social-regexp): Updated to allow
    github#user/project/commit-hashtag references.  So now all of the
    following are recognized as github commit links if the default user
    and project settings are set up:
      gh#rswgnu/hyperbole/5ae3550 (if include user must include project)
      github#hyperbole/5ae3550    (project can be given with user default)
      gh#5ae3550                  (user and project defaults are used)

    Additionally, gh@rswgnu can be used to jump to user rswgnu's github
    home page.
  DEMO (Github): Added to demonstrate github references.

* hibtypes.el (annot-bib): Moved in priority below social hashtags and
    denied matching to anything containing a # or @ character so
    [twitter@someuser] doesn't match as an annot-bib entry.

* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Added helm support for Smart Key presses in
   the minibuffer window (runs the standard RET command).

2017-09-18  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-mouse.el (smart-helm): Finalized and added doc. of contexts and actions.
    Made smart-helm ignore helm candidate separator lines.

* hui-window.el (smart-coords-in-window-p):
                (hmouse-drag-window-side): Handled null value of coords.

2017-09-17  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Changed minibuffer handling to support Helm.

* man/hkey-help.txt: Small updates to Special Mode doc.

* hmouse-key.el (hmouse-add-unshifted-keys): Added to allow user init
    of unshifted Smart Keys.  For GNU Emacs only, this binds
    [mouse-2] to the Action Key and [mouse-3] to the Assist Key.
  man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key Bindings): Added doc for hmouse-add-unshifted-keys.

* hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-get-unshifted-bindings): Uncommented inclusion of
   mouse-3 for times when user manually sets mouse-3 as the Assist Key.
   Otherwise, hmouse-toggle-bindings will never change its value.
               (hmouse-bind-key, hmouse-bind-shifted-key): Added and used
   these to ensure depress and release bindings are wholly reset before
   rebinding them under GNU Emacs.

2017-09-14  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hpath.el (hpath:external-open-office-suffixes): Added .odt suffix.

* hui-select.el (hui-select-at-p): Protect against empty buffer error.

2017-09-12  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hibtypes.el (grep-msg):
              (pathname): Don't match in helm completion buffers.

* hui-mouse.el (smart-helm-line-has-action): Ignore any actions helm
    imputes to header lines and candidate separator lines in helm
    completion buffers, as they are non-actionable lines.  Also, ignore
    if at the end of the buffer.
               (hkey-alist): Lowered smart-helm priority so can use Smart
    Key end-of-line functions in such buffers.

* hsys-www.el (eww-link-at-point): Basic stylistic improvements.

2017-09-11  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

hyrolo.el: Added basic commentary to the file header.

2017-09-10  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-mouse.el (smart-helm, smart-helm-assist, smart-helm-line-has-action):
  hsettings.el (helm-allow-mouse): Set to t.
    New helm completion activation support.
    Added to allow mouse direct selection of helm completion items and to see
    match item actions prior to invoking them.  The smart-helm function
    behaves similarly to the {C-j} and {C-z} key bindings that helm mode
    provides when a helm completion is active. If helm is not active,
    Hyperbole resumes the prior helm session before triggering the action.
    The smart-helm-assist function displays the match item and its associated
    action.

* hsys-www.el (www-url): Added Action and Assist Key support for browsing
    links in eww (the Emacs web browser) and for activating history links
    in the eww history buffer.

2017-09-08  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hpath.el (hpath:url-regexp3): Added a third pattern match for URLs,
   allowing for partial http urls with non-www site names preceded by the
   literal url or URL followed by a : or =.  For example:
   url:photos.google.com or url=calendar.google.com

2017-09-07  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-menu.el (hui-menu-browser): Changed the Default setting to always
    use the current setting of browse-url-default-browser since that is the
    default in browse-url (eliminated use of browse-url-generic).

* hypb.el (hypb:decode-url): Added.
  hpath.el (hpath:is-p): Fixed to handle and decode encoded URL paths before
    returning the path.

2017-09-06  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Changed Python predicate to match more
broadly, namely in any non-file buffer whose name includes Pydoc: or
Python (case-sensitive).

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-python-at-tag-p): Expanded to handle tags with
   periods embedded such as `sys.path'.

2017-09-04  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hibtypes.el (debugger-source): Added support for Python pdb stack trace lines.

2017-08-31  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hibtypes.el (pathname): Wrapped mode-name reference in format-mode-line
    call since mode-name is not always a string.

* hui-em-but.el (hproperty:but-highlight-p): Added to allow disabling of explicit button highlighting.
                (hproperty:but-create-all):  Used this new flag.
  hui-xe-but.el (hproperty:but-highlight-p): Added to allow disabling of explicit button highlighting.
                (hproperty:but-create-all):  Used this new flag.

* hbut.el (ebut:map): Changed to ignore explicit button matches in
    programming languages when outside of a comment.  For example, syntax like
    this in a Rust buffer had been improperly matched: fn parse_kv(kv_list:
    Vec<(syn::Ident, syn::StrLit)>, function: &Function) -> LispFnArgs

2017-08-25  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-mouse.el (smart-ibuffer-menu): Ibuffer calling conventions have
    changed across time (as of Emacs25) to allow for regional arguments;
    updated to account for these.

* hpath.el (hpath:remote-at-p): For Emacs 26 where
    tramp-file-name-structure is now a function instead of a variable, call
    the function.

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-kill): Triggered error if FILE contains a '*' character,
    mainly in case a buffer name is passed as an argument.
            (hyrolo-file-list-initialize): Added this function so can
    re-initialize the hyrolo-file-list later if BBDB or Google Contacts
    support is loaded after the Hyperbole Rolo is initialized.

* hbut.el (hbut:source): Allowed for spaces in buffer names.

* hyrolo.el (hyrolo-edit-entry): Avoided error if bbdb-file is nil.

* hbut.el (ebut:label-p): Added one-line-flag to constrain label search to a single line.
  hibtypes.el (Info-node): Constrained Info-node hyper-button matches to a single line.

* hyrolo.el: Added support for Google Contacts when the google-contacts
    package is in use and a public key package is available for Google
    authorization.

2016-09-08  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

2016-08-26  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Added Smart Key jump to associated page in pages-directory-mode (page-ext.el).
  man/hkey-help.txt: Documented Pages Directory Listing and Imenu Programming Identifier handling.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help-show): Modified to invoke help-mode only if buffer name includes 'Help' to
    support other specialized modes that use temp buffers.

2016-08-25  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* README.md, README.md.html: Updated to match Hyperbole home page.

2016-08-18  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hib-debbugs.el: Added a note about bug-reference-mode.el and the differences.

2016-08-17  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* README: Added Summary section with a description of Hyperbole since this file may be shown prior to
    download in the Emacs package manager.

* kotl/kexport.el (kexport:label-html-font-attributes): Fixed improper 'defvar' definition which should
    have been a 'defcustom'.

2016-08-16  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key:normalize): Fixed so C-M-<char> is normalized the same way as M-C-<char>.
             (kbd-key:extended-command-prefix): Added.
             (kbd-key, kbd-key:act): Added kbd-key:extended-command-p test and used in this implicit button
    type and action type to support Action Key presses on M-x extended commands like {M-x occur RET} since
    these are included in the Hyperbole DEMO.

2016-08-15  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hpath.el (hpath:substitute-dir): Added support for environment variables including those with PATH
    in their name (colon-separated paths) that should have been there.
    Added call to hpath:exists-p to test path with hpath:suffixes added.  This fixed the bug where
    "${load-path}/simple.el" did not resolve properly when the file was stored compressed
    as simple.el.gz, for example.

2016-08-12  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-mini.el (hui:menu-enter): Fixed potential error of (wrong-type-argument char-or-string-p 134217741)
    when insert was called with a non-character code integer.

2016-08-10  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* HY-ANNOUNCE-SHORT - Added as a shorter release announcement.

* HY-ABOUT, README, README.md, README.md.html - Synchronized with Hyperbole web home page
    and typo fixes.

    Open Office documents based on this new option.
           (hpath:command-string): Quoted filename argument to allow spaces in filenames.
    This fixed an issue when an external viewer such as `open' was called under OS X
    and the filename to be opened contained spaces.

* hyperbole.el (Maintainer): Changed back to single line so ELPA parses it correctly.

* hib-debbugs.el (debbugs-gnu-query:list):
  hyperbole.el (hkey-global-set-key, Info-directory-list):
  hvar.el (var:append): Removed improper function quoting of variable.

    "DEMO#Grep, Occurrence, Debugger and Compiler Error Buttons, and Cscope Analyzer".

* Demo (Org Mode):
  man/hyperbole.texi (Implicit Buttons):

    then invokes the Org mode standard binding of M-RET, (org-meta-return).

2016-08-07  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hpath.el (hpath:markup-link-anchor-regexp, hpath:to-markup-anchor): Modified to support hash-style links

    Added recognition of section links like:
        - [Why was Hyperbole developed?](#why-was-hyperbole-developed)

      hash character and jumps to the section:
        ## Why was Hyperbole developed?
      accounting for any trailing punctuation, whitespace and differences in case.
           (hpath:markdown-suffix-regexp, hpath:markdown-anchor-id-pattern, hpath:markdown-section-pattern): Added.

2016-07-31  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

    Find/Web search menu directly.
  hyperbole.el (hkey-initialize): Bound above command to {C-c /}.

    the menubar with the latest version of the Hyperbole menu; previously
    it only added the menu if it was not there.

2016-07-29  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* README.md: Added menu images and screenshots for easy access.

* hui-mouse.el (action-key-eol-function, assist-key-eol-function): Added these 2

  README (Files): Added pointers to Hyperbole screenshot files.

*  man/im/menu-hyperbole2.pdf: Removed this unneeded file.

* HY-ANNOUNCE: Updated first section and used in sending 6.0.1 release announcements.
    Added items from HY-NEWS for 6.0.1 that were unintentially left out of this file.

* hload-path.el (hyperb:dir): If the Emacs Package Manager has already added this

2016-07-21  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hsettings.el: Renamed this from hsite.el to prevent Hyperbole V4 users from
    accidentally loading it manually.

    so if it is already there, it won't be added again.

* hyperbole.el (hkey-override-local-bindings): Fixed case where an invalid
    key prefix is given and so local-key-binding returns a number rather than nil.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-x-coord): Added support for a marker as `args'.
  hypb.el (hypb:goto-marker): Added to jump to a marker in a different buffer.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Global Key Bindings): Changed from setting the value of
    hkey-init-override-local-keys in personal init file to using the
    customize-variable interface.

* MANIFEST: Eliminated hsite-ex.el and included hsite.el in distribution package.
    Users will use customizations now rather than direct editing of this file.

    Hyperbole key bindings on and off.
  hmouse-key.el (hmouse-toggle-bindings): Showed message only if called interactively.
               (hkey-binding-entry, hkey-bindings-keys): Added to encapsulate binding storage format.
	       (hkey-initialize): Stored Hyperbole key binding entries.

    when set.
  hui-mini.el (hui:menu-help): This fixed an issue where Hyperbole minibuffer menu item help window
    quit did not properly restore prior window configuration.

2016-07-06  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hypb.el (hypb:maximize-window-height): Added.
  hib-debbugs.el (debbugs-gnu-mode, smart-debbugs-gnu, debbugs-gnu-mode:help): Added to support
    the Smart Keys in Gnu Debbugs listing buffers.

* hversion.el (id-info, id-info-item): Generalized and improved file handling.

2016-07-05  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* man/hyperbole.texi (Creation Via Action Key Drags): Small improvements.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key - Identifier Menu Mode ): Renamed and updated with imenu support.
  hui-mouse.el (smart-imenu-display-item-where, smart-item-menu-p, smart-imenu-item-at-p): Added
    these functions and to use the Emacs imenu library to display programming identifiers defined
    within the same file in which they are referenced.  This works without a TAGS file and on files
    that have not yet been evaluated within the current Emacs session.
               (hkey-alist): Added imenu support: Action Key press on an imenu identifier displays
    its definition; Assist Key press prompts with completion for an identifier defined within the
    current buffer to display.

* hargs.el (hargs:find-tag-default): Added and used in hargs:at-p and hibtypes.el (hyp-address).
    This supports the newer find-tag-default-function which may be major-mode specific.

* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key): Added support to recognized key sequences in GNU standard Info manuals where
    they are surrounded by a form of smart quotes.
    (kbd-key:normalize): Added support for special keys delimited by angle brackets, e.g. <SPC>.

    can be used in multiple places.
  hactypes.el (link-to-file-line-and-column): Added.
  hibtypes.el (pathname): Called hpath:delimited-possible-path.
              (pathname-line-and-column): Added this new implicit button type and
    documented it.

* hibtypes.el: Updated all to use match-string-no-properties.

2016-07-02  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hsys-org.el: New file added; defines an implicit button type, org-mode, that
    displays Org mode links in a web browser and cycles through outline headings.
  hibtypes.el (require 'hsys-org): Added.
  man/hyperbole.texi (Implicit Buttons - org-mode):
  DEMO (Org Mode): Updated doc to reflect this behavior.

* hargs.el (hargs:delimited): Added optional 5th arg, LIST-POSITIONS-FLAG, which
    if non-nil makes the return value a list of (string-matched start-pos end pos).
    This is used for flashing any matching implicit button when activated.

* hui-mini.el (hui:menu-backward-item, hui:menu-forward-item): Added these to move
    point through minibuffer menu items; bound to SHIFT-TAB (or M-TAB) and to TAB.

* hmouse-info.el: Renamed for consistency from hmous-info.el.
    (require 'info): Added to be sure this is always loaded.

* hactypes.el (link-to-Info-node): If lookup as a node fails, try it as an index
    item name.  This allows for implicit links of the type "(file)index-item-name".

* hui.el (hui:link-directly): Removed any text properties from string arguments in
    case they are unintentially copied.

2016-07-01  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui.el (hui:link-directly): Updated message after creation to include arguments
    so the user sees what is linked to.

* hmous-info.el (Info-handle-in-menu): Called Info-menu-item-at-point.
                (Info-note-at-p): Added.

  hargs.el (hargs:at-p): When reading an Info-node or Info-index-item, if point is
    on a cross-reference or menu item, make the link to that item, not to the
    current Info node.
  hmous-info.el (Info-read-index-item-name, Info-build-menu-item-completions,
    Info-complete-menu-item, Info-current-filename-sans-extension,
    Info-menu-item-at-p, Info-node-has-menu-p, Info-read-index-item-name-1): Added.
  hui.el (hui:link-possible-types):
  hactypes.el (link-to-Info-index-item):
  hargs.el (hargs:iforms-extensions, hargs:at-p): Added link-to-Info-index-item
    action type (interactive spec of +X) with full completion of Info index nodes
    across all installed Info manuals (at link creation time).  Added to
    documentation.
  DEMO (Info Paths): Updated to include index item links.

* hact.el (action:params): Changed to return nil if ACTION argument is an Emacs
    byte-coded function with a variable number of arguments in which case the
    function parameters are not available.  This fixed an error in the function
    kotl-mode where it expected a list to be returned, bug#23873.

2016-06-30  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* Makefile: Removed ps_dir since now make a .pdf file, not a .ps and removed any
    mention of a PostScript manual.

==============================================================================
V5.15 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

2016-06-29  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hvm.el, hui-xe-but.el, kotl/kprop-xe.el: Set to not byte compile since will be rarely
    used and reduces the byte-compiler warnings.

* hactypes.el: Replaced comint-kill-output with newer comint-delete-output.
    Replaced shell-sent-input with comint-send-input.

* hui-em-but.el: Added hyperbole group for all faces.

* hmouse-key.el (require 'hsite): Added this and replaced require of hversion so
    hmouse-middle-flag is defined at compile-time.

* hmh.el (Mh-to): Removed called to no longer existing Mh-get-buffer and changed variable name
    to currently used mh-show-buffer (all lower-case).

* hib-doc-id.el (require 'wrolo): Added for rolo-grep calls.

* hmouse-tag.el (eval-and-compile): Added this call around requires and loads.

* kotl/kimport.el (require 'kfile): Added.
  kotl/kcell.el (require 'kview): Added.

* All Files (with-current-buffer): Used in place of (save-excursion (set-buffer...))

* wrolo.el, wrolo-logic.el, wconfig.el, kotl/kexport.el, hvm.el, hui.el, hui-select.el:
    Replaced all remaining calls of (interactive-p) with
    (called-interactively-p 'interactive).

* hinit.el (hyperb:init): Moved to hyperbole.el to resolve a compile-time warning.
  hload-path.el: Added and moved load-path settings from hversion.el and hyperbole.el here
    and required this file in hversion.el.  This is so the kotl/ directory is added to
    load-path when just hversion.el is required.  This fixes an issue in hinit.el which
    required hibtypes.el which required klink.el before kotl/ was in the load-path.
  hversion.el (hyperb:kotl-p): Moved Koutline mode initializations from hyperbole.el
    to here since hversion is sometimes required at compile time without requiring
    the hyperbole library and we need the kotl/ subdirectory on load-path then.
  kotl/kimport.el (kimport:mode-alist, kimport:suffix-alist): Moved these 2 definitions
    from hyperbole.el back into this file since they are autoloaded and only used herein.
  hgnus.el (require 'hypb): Added.
  hsmail.el (smail:comment-add): Rewrote as a no-op if inhibit-hyperbole-messaging is nil.
            (message-setup-hook, mh-letter-mode-hook): Changed to use add-hook rather than
    var:append.  This solved a compile-time problem where inhibit-hyperbole-messaging was
    not yet defined (from hyperbole.el) but was used in the var:append call.

* htz.el (htz:span-in-days): Renamed call of calendar-absolute-from-julian
    to newer calendar-julian-to-absolute.

* hsmail.el (var:append): Fixed issue where inhibit-hyperbole-messaging was not defined
    at compile time, causing a failure of hgnus.el (which requires hsmail) to compile.
  hib-debbugs.el (debbugs-query:status): Added (require 'debbugs-gnu).
  hib-doc-id.el:
  hib-kbd.el:
  hib-debbugs.el (require 'hactypes): Added missing require and eval-when-compile
    needed for package compilation.
  hact.el, hactypes.el, hbut.el, hgnus.el, hinit.el, hmh.el, hrmail.el, hui-menu.el,
  hversion.el, hypb.el, kotl/kcell.el, kotl/kfile.el, kotl/kotl-mode.el, kotl/kview.el:
    Added eval-when-compile needed for package compilation.

==============================================================================
V5.14 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

2016-06-28  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu): Fixed menubar Manual pointers for Find,
    Koutliner, and Screen.  Also renamed Hyperbole submenu to Koutliner from
    Koutline to distinguish it from the mode-specific Koutline menubar menu.
  hversion.el (id-info-item): Added and used in menubar menus to go to Info index entries.
              (id-info): Trigged an error if argument is not a string.
	      (infodock-hyperbole-menu):

* HY-README: Expanded the installation instructions here with additional pointers.

* hpath.el (hpath:get-external-display-alist): Renamed from hpath:find-alist and
    changed it from a variable to a function so it is resolved on a per-frame basis
    since each frame may have different window-system value when using distributed
    window systems.  Improved documentation.
	   (hpath:external-display-alist-macos)
	   (hpath:external-display-alist-mswindows)
	   (hpath:external-display-alist-x): Added these variables for use with
    each window system.
           (hpath:internal-display-alist): Renamed from hpath:display-alist.

* hactypes.el (link-to-Info-node): Updated doc to explain that completion is
    available and there is no need to include a .info suffix for the filename.

* hib-debbugs.el (debbugs-gnu-query, debbugs-gnu-query:string): Fixed some edge
    cases with internal and trailing spacing.

* DEMO (Thing Selection): Added this section.

* hpath.el (hpath:find-file-urls-p): Removed message and beep call; made a pure predicate.
           (hpath:enable-find-file-urls): Added a beep and message if called interactively
   and no remote path library is loaded.

2016-06-27  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* DEMO (HyControl, Creating and Modifying Explicit Buttons): Added these sections.
    Reworked and updated the demo to reflect the current state of Hyperbole.

* hbut.el (ebut:operate): Fixed bug where point was left on a button different than
    the one operated upon by changing (forward-char 1) to (forward-char 2).

* hargs.el (hargs:iforms-extensions): Simplified ?I (read an Info-node name) to call
    Info-read-node-name.  This allows use of filename prefixes without the .info suffix,
    e.g. (hyperbole) while still supplying completions.

* hactypes.el (link-to-Info-node): Changed to call match-string-no-properties.

* hibtypes.el (man-apropos): Fixed for new Emacs versions.
    (rfc): Fixed to allow a space in the middle to match documentation.

* hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu): Moved the Types menu below the
    Documentation menu to match the Hyperbole minibuffer menu.
  hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu):
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus): Added Types item on the Explicit Buttons menu to display
    action types; this matches the same item from the IBut menu.

* DEMO: Removed description of Cust/Find-File-URLs as this is a bit advanced.  Doc is
    available instead at "(hyperbole)Using URLs with Find-File".
  man/hyperbole.texi (Using URLs with Find-File): Fixed to refer to the newer name,
    hpath:find-file-urls-mode rather than hyperb:find-file-urls-mode.

* DEMO (Path Suffixes and Variables): Added this section with more examples and removed
    description of hpath:display-alist; documented in the Hyperbole Manual instead.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Internal Viewers): Added description of file formats supported
    by the default setting of hpath:display-alist.

* hibtypes.el (pathname): Excluded paths that start with ~ from expansion via
    load-path matching and changed to call locate-library so compressed Lisp files
    are found.  Added support for Info filenames without any path (displays Top node).
  hpath.el (hpath:info-suffix): Added and used in hpath:display-alist and implicit
    type pathname definition.

2016-06-25  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hpath.el (hpath:display-alist): Added audio format mp3, wav and ogg suffixes.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Link Variable Substitution): Small text fixes.

2016-06-24  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-window.el (hmouse-inactive-minibuffer-p): Added and used at the
    start of hmouse-alist.  This added Smart Key support for an inactive
    minibuffer.  Action Mouse Key click displays the Hyperbole minibuffer
    menu for easy item selection with the Action Mouse Key.  Assist
    Mouse Key click pops up the jump menu of frames, buffers and windows,
    just as a blank area in the modeline does.
                (action-key-minibuffer-function, assist-key-minibuffer-function):
    Added these variables and used at the start of hmouse-alist.
                (action-key-modeline-function, assist-key-modeline-function):
    Changed name from *-hook since should only be set to a single function.

2016-06-23  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-window.el (hmouse-depress-inactive-minibuffer-p): Added and used in
    action-key-depress and assist-key-depress.
  hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-shifted-setup): For GNU Emacs, changed
    hmouse-set-point-command to hmouse-move-point-emacs.
    (hmouse-move-point-emacs): Added.

* hycontrol.el (frame-pixel-*): Changed all these calls to hycontrol-frame-*
    to include any window manager decorations in the calculation.
               (hycontrol-frame-height, hycontrol-frame-width): Added.

* hyperbole.el (hyperbole, hyperbole-keys): Added these customization
    groups; used by hmouse-mod.el.
  hmouse-mod.el (hmouse-mod-disable): Renamed from hmouse-mod-unset-global-map.
    (hmouse-mod-enable): Renamed from hmouse-mod-set-global-map.
    (hmouse-mod-mode): Added this to make it a minor mode and replaced
  hmouse-mod-toggle.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Glossary): Added Chord Keyboard entry.
                     (Smart Key Modifiers, Smart Key Modeline): Added
    these sections.

* hib-kbd.el (kbd-key): Tightened to not match when point is on the
   outside curly brace characters, thereby allowing hui-select-delimited-thing
   to select the delimited key sequence.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Implicit Buttons): Added debbugs-gnu-query doc.

2016-06-22  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key Operations): Updated this section and
    fixed documentation error concerning where to click the Action Mouse
    Key to bring up the Info Browser.

* hui-mini.el (hui:menus): Changed from Doc/SmartKy to Doc/SmartKeys.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-summarize): Made interactive so can be bound to a key.
    Deleted return to previously selected window, so can browse through
    the help and then use {q} to restore the window configuration.
  hui-mouse.el (action-key-error): Changed to call hypb:error.
               (assist-key-error): Added and changed assist-key-default-function
    to default to this, since its prior value, hkey-summarize, is
    performed by an Assist Key click in the right of a modeline.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp-at-tag-p): Added &, ~, and ^ as identifier
    characters and removed #.

2016-06-21  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hib-debbugs.el: Added to browse discussion and show the status of Gnu
    debbugs issues embedded in any buffer.
  hibtypes.el (require 'hib-debbugs): Added.
  MANIFEST: Added an entry for this.
  Makefile: Added file entries.

* hbut.el (hattr:report): Simplified conditionals and printing via format.

* hui-mini.el (hui:menu-help): Fixed to handle windows already split side-by-side
    and to leave point in the help buffer (so can use {q} to quit) if not called
    from within the minibuffer, e.g. when on an implicit button.

2016-06-20  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-mini.el (hui:menu-doc, hui:menu-item-doc): Added and added
    parameters to their callers to allow for return of menu item
    documentation strings used by implicit keyboard buttons in hib-kbd.el.
    This allowed display of documentation of Hyperbole minibuffer menu
    items from readable key sequence strings via the Assist Key.

 hib-kbd.el (kbd-key:normalize): Added support for RETURN fully spelled out.
             (kbd-key:hyperbole-menu-key-p): Added.
             (kbd-key:doc): Added error if no doc found for a key-sequence.
             (ibtypes::kbd-key, kbd-key:act): Added support for invoking Hyperbole
    minibuffer menu items with the Action Key when over a sequence of keys
    like, e.g. {C-h h d d}.
             (kbd-key:normalize): Added error if argument is not a string.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-set-buffer-and-point): Added.
    (hmouse-goto-depress-prev-point, hmouse-goto-depress-point,
     hmouse-goto-region-point, hmouse-goto-release-point): Called `hmouse-set-buffer-and-point'.

* hui-mouse.el (smart-gnus-summary, smart-gnus-summary-assist): Changed from
    no-longer existing call of `gnus-summary-mark-unread-forward/backward' to
    `gnus-summary-mark-article-as-unread'.

2016-06-19  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* wrolo.el (rolo-sort-lines): Added to handle sorting of collapsed rolo
   records properly since through Emacs 25.0 invisible lines are not
   grouped with the prior visible line, making rolo entry (or any record)
   sorts fail.  This function fixes that.
           (rolo-forward-visible-line): Added to support rolo-sort-lines.

2016-06-18  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hversion.el (hyperb:window-sys-term): Added per frame check for mouse
   support, notably for graphical emacsclient spawned from a non-graphical
   Emacs.  Previously such clients did not have Hyperbole mouse support;
   now they do.
     (hyperb:window-sys-term): Changed to take a single frame argument and
       set the value of 'hyperb:window-system into the frame parameters.
     (hyperb:window-system): Deleted this variable; now should be
       called as a function only.  Added this as a function to return the
       frame-specific value of `hyperb:window-system'.
  hmouse-drv.el (hkey-operate, hmouse-set-point):
  hypb.el (hypb:configuration):
  hyperbole.el (hkey-initialize):
  hui-window.el (hmouse-drag-window-side, hmouse-modeline-depress,

   call for hyperb:window-system.
  hui-window.el: Simplified hmouse-alist setup a bit.
  hui-mouse.el (hmouse-alist): Changed to always define this since one may start
    Emacs on a tty and then use a distributed window system to create a frame under
    a window system with mouse support that needs this.

2016-06-17  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-jmenu.el (hui-menu-of-buffers): Removed limit on top-level buffer menu length, i.e.
    the number of categories/major modes.

V5.13 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

2016-06-15  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-jmenu.el (interactive "e"): Removed "e" from menu commands that take
    no arguments.

* hact.el (symset, htype): Moved from hbut.el because actype:create uses
    htype and htype uses symset it and hbut.el requires hact.el, so we
    can't require hbut here.  This solved an installation problem where
    hact was byte-compiled before hbut was loaded and produced an invalid
    defact/actype:create macro which then caused hactypes.el to fail
    upon loading.  Also forced a load of set.el at compile time to satisfy
    Hyperbole package builder.
  hactypes.el (hact.el): Forced a load at compile time to satisfy Hyperbole
    package builder.
  hbut.el (hversion): Added require of this library; needed for
    hyperb:microcruft-os-p definition at load time.

   (action-mouse-key, assist-mouse-key, action-key, assist-key): Refactored
     to call the above internal functions.  Made action-key and assist-key
     clear all the action mouse key variables so there can be no confusion
     between mouse presses and keyboard presses.

   (hkey-help-show): Generalized handling of completions buffers
    and thereby fixed an issue in Emacs 24 where completions were not showing.

* hpath.el (hpath:remote-at-p): Tightened matches to require at least one
    char after the : to prevent false matches, e.g. to node:: in Texinfo files.
           (hpath:at-p): Tightened space delimited match to exclude @ characters.

           (hpath:find-alist): Added .pdf to mac-osx-suffixes and removed

    Redid image insertion so is no longer conditionalized by output type
    and uses @image and @caption.

* Makefile:
  HY-WHY.kotl: Added this file as a quick list of reasons to use
    Hyperbole.  More are welcome.

2016-06-09  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hargs.el (hargs:delimited): Fixed to not return an empty string.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:set-cell-attribute): Fixed interactive part,
    added error if called non-interactively in a read-only buffer
    and improved prompts.

* kotl/kview.el (kview:set-buffer): Renamed from kview:set-buffer-name
    since it could get out of sync if some other library changed the
    buffer name leading to kview:buffer returning nil.  Now the buffer
    itself is stored.
  kotl/kfile.el (kfile:write): Called kview:set-buffer.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode-map): Added missing {C-c C-i} binding

      save the prior global map and restore it later.
    (hmouse-mod-execute-command): Added setting of prefix argument for
      commands and made to support any self-inserting-character.
    (hmouse-mod-toggle): Added to toggle this on and off.

                 smart-c-keywords, smart-objc-keywords, smart-python-keywords):
    Added to prevent tag matches in smart-*-at-tag-p.
		(smart-asm-at-tag-p, smart-c-at-tag-p)
                 smart-fortran-at-tag-p, smart-lisp-at-tag-p):
    Added optional no-flash parameter for when called after button has
    already been flashed.

    (rolo-isearch, rolo-isearch-regexp, rolo-locate): Rewrote and called rolo-isearch-for-regexp.
    (wrolo-mode-map): Changed to {M-s} rolo-isearch and {C-u M-s} rolo-isearch-regexp key bindings.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key Bindings): Removed {C-c C-t} binding for
    hmouse-toggle-bindings to force the user to invoke this command by name or
    to bind it themselves, so they really know what they are doing before use.
    Also, this key collided with outlining usage in the Koutliner and Rolo tools.
    Suggested a personal binding if needed.
  hyperbole.el (hkey-initialize): Removed {C-c C-t} global binding.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp-bound-symbol-def): Added with fix for if one
    of the 3 functions called herein triggers an error.  Previously, the
    condition-case was outside of all three, preventing testing each in turn
    if one signaled an error.

    above function here.

* wrolo.el (rolo-bbdb-grep): Modified to make buffer unmodified and set to

    (wrolo-mode-map): Added {o} key bound to new function rolo-overview.  Shows first
      line of all levels of rolo matches.
    (rolo-top-level): Added and bound to {t} since previous binding of {t}
      did not work when multiple levels of cells were showing upon command invocation.

    backslash double quotes in patterns.

* hsmail.el (smail:comment): Disabled by default since not many people
    ever embedded buttons in mail.

* hypb.el (hypb:toggle-isearch-invisible): Added and used in menus.

  hsite-ex.el (hyperb:stack-frame '(package-install)): The Emacs package
    installer might load this file during package installation before
    hyperbole.el is loaded. Test for this case and allow.
              (hversion): Required.

2016-05-23  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyperbole.el (hyperb:package-autoloads-subdirectories-p): Added code to
    ensure Koutliner autoloads in kotl/ subdirectory are generated and
    loaded since these are now generated by the Emacs package system which
    may require a patch to handle subdirectories in patches.  Hyperbole
    automatically applies the patch if need be.
               (hyperb:init): Call this after-init-time so {M-RET} binding
    and others are not overridden.

* Makefile (dist): Removed and replaced with package target.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp-at-tag-p): Added /, = and ? as valid identifier characters.

* Makefile (temp_dir): Removed this directory; used dist_dir instead.
           (dist_hyperbole): Renamed from temp_hyperbole.

* hpath.el (hpath:push-tag-mark): Added xref support.

* kotl/EXAMPLE.kotl:
* man/hyperbole.texi (View Specs): Noted that turning ellipses off may not work in Emac25.

2016-05-22  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyperbole.el ((hkey-override-local-bindings, hkey-global-set-key): Added key-description to saved key list
    and fixed the first function to override keys properly.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Autonumbering):
  kotl/kvspec.el (kvspec:label-type-alist):
  kotl/kmenu.el (kotl-menu-common-body):
  kotl/kview.el (kview:default-label-type, kview:set-label-type): Disabled partial-alpha, start and
    no labeling in outlines since there are likely problems with each and
    no major need for them.

* kotl/kview.el (kview:id-counter): Added and used.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:add-cell): Conditionalized
    klabel-type:update-labels call to update sibling labels to apply only to
    label-types that require sequential updating.  This eliminated a problem
    when idstamp labels were in use and the counter would increase twice for
    each cell added.

* kotl/klabel.el (klabel:idstamp-p): Added and used to prevent
    incrementing idstamp count in multiple places.

* kotl/kview.el (kcell-view:create): Generalized and rewrote the way label
   is generated to account for kview's label-type.
  kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:kill-tree):
  kotl/kfile.el (kfile:create): Called kview:add-cell with parameter of
    "0" rather than "1" so proper label type is generated.
    (kcell-view:create): Updated to handle various label-types.

* kotl/klabel.el (klabel-type:increment, klabel:increment-alpha)
    (klabel:increment-partial-alpha, klabel:increment-legal): Changed to
      compute first child of 0 root cell, rather than trigger an error.

* kotl/kview.el (kview:set-label-type): Reset per kview function
    definitions even if the label type doesn't change, as these function
    definitions might have changed.

* kotl/klabel.el (klabel-type:function): Removed string formatting of
    idstamp labels as they are already returned as strings.

* kotl/kview.el (hyperb:emacs-p): Optimized to skip to the end of each kcell property

* kotl/klabel.el (klabel-type:child, klabel-type:increment, klabel:level, klabel-type:parent):
    Added support for idstamp and partial-alpha labels.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:end-of-cell): Fixed handling of arg other
    than 1 and noted that this applies only to visible cells.

* kotl/kview.el (kcell-view:level): Deleted save excursion and stopped moving point.

* kotl/klabel.el (klabel-type:legal-label): Improved naming and fixed
    where string should have been referenced but index was instead.
    (kotl-label:log26): Deleted and replaced with a direct call of (log n 26).
    (klabel-type:update-tree-labels): Added missing first-label parameter.

* kotl/kmenu.el (kotl-menu-common-body): Rearranged movement items so prev
    item of matching item pair always comes first.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode-map): Added explicit {C-x i} binding to
   kotl-mode:insert-file since sometimes, e.g. with ido.el loaded, the
   insert-file command is remapped to another command in the global map and
   then the implicit local key binding doesn't happen.
  kotl/kimport (kimport:insert-file): Renamed from kotl-mode:insert-file.
               (kimport:insert-file-contents): Renamed from kotl-mode:insert-file-contents.
	       (kimport:insert-buffer): Renamed from kotl-mode:insert-buffer.
	       (kimport:insert-register): Renamed from kotl-mode:insert-register.

* kotl/klink.el (klink:at-p): Fixed issue with missing fall-through
    condition causing <@ 2b1a> style klinks to be missed.

2016-05-21  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hsite-ex.el (find-file-hook): Changed from older find-file-hooks.

* kotl/kfile.el (kfile:find-file-hook): Removed; unnecessary since file
    reading code has already put point at a valid position before this hook
    was called to do that.  Removal eliminates mutual dependency on
    kotl-mode.el.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Hook Variables):
  hinit.el (hyperb:init):
  DEMO (hyperbole-init-hook): Renamed this variable from hyperb:init-hook.

* hactypes.el (annot-bib): Fixed to not move point in source window.

* hbut.el (ebut:key-src): Tightened search for @loc> button source to only
    look prior to the end of the current line.  Also, changed to ignore
    this source if the explicit button is within a file buffer.  This
    fixed an issue in DEMO where the wrong button source was chosen for an
    explicit button because of a @loc> later in the file.

* dir: Added as part of Hyperbole packaging for adding Hyperbole to the
    Emacs category info directory tree.

* DEMO:
  man/hyperbole.texi:
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus): Changed all references of Outliner to Koutliner.

* Makefile (version): Added man/version.texi version number check.

* hrmail.el (require): Simplified requires.

* hyperbole.el ("Hyperbole %s is ready for action."): Added version number
    to this message.
               (autoload): Removed duplicative autoloads now loaded from
    hyperbole-autoloads.
  kotl/kotl-mode.el (require): Removed kview and kimport; added kfile.
  kotl/kfile.el (require): Removed kotl-mode; added kview.
  kotl/kimport.el (require): Added kotl-mode, allowing removal of more
    duplicative autoloads.


* hpath.el (hpath:display-buffer): Made an autoload since used in hooks.

* Makefile (package): Added this and packageclean targets.  Added remove
    of GNUmakefile.id (not used) in distclean.

2016-05-20  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyperbole.el (hyperb:dir): Set from load-file-name if available, e.g.
    when Hyperbole is installed as an Emacs package.

* hyperbole-autoloads.el: Renamed from auto-autoloads.el and added kotl/
    autoloads in here as well.  Require this from hyperbole.el so it can
    redefine some of the autoloads to load more of Hyperbole when called.

* hypb.el (hypb:locate): Added and required locate library.
          (hypb:locate-pathnames): Added.
  hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu): Added Find/Locate-Files.
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus): Added Find/LocateFiles.
          (hypb:rgrep): Rewrote so if in the *Locate* output buffer from
    the locate command, then the grep is done on the files listed therein.

* hyperbole.el (hkey-override-local-bindings): Fixed bug that argument is
    a cons pair, allowing for local binding overrides.

* hui-select.el (hui-select-at-delimited-thing-p): Rewrote to handle
    comments whose syntax is marked as punctuation and thus allow the
    action key to select comments.

2016-05-19  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-select.el (hui-select-comment): Added save-excursion in first cond
    predicate so point remains for 2nd conditional.

* hsite-ex.el: (hyperbole-loading): Prevented manual require/load of
    hsite library.  Require/load hyperbole library instead.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:to-visible-position): Updated so when
    backward-p is true, only consider visibility of the character before point.

* hui-select.el (hui-select-initialize): help-mode - match to Lisp symbols with : in
    their names, often included in help buffers.

* hargs.el (hargs:at-p, hargs:iforms-extensions):
  hactypes.el (link-to-Info-node): Removed old reference to Info-directory.
  (hargs:iforms-extensions): When reading a kcell label, match only to
  presently visible cells.

* hargs.el (hargs:read-match): Generalized doc string and if input is
    empty, return the default `initial-input' value instead.
  kotl/kview.el (kcell-view:visible-label): Added and used in hargs:read-match.

* kotl/kview.el (kview:get-cells-status): Added missing (goto-char start).

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:demote-tree, kotl-mode:promote-tree):
  kotl/kview.el (kview:map-siblings, kview:map-expanded-tree, kview:map-tree):
    Called kotl-mode:to-start-of-line to handle edge case when a tree is
    collapsed, its branches hidden and point is after the hidden branches.
    Otherwise, the visible tree is missed.  Also ensured point ends up
    back in the same cell where it started.
    (kotl-mode:move-before, kotl-mode:move-after): Removed unused `orig' marker.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:start-of-line): Renamed to kotl-mode:to-start-of-line
    to clarify that it moves point.
                    (kotl-mode:just-one-space): Fixed point movement issue
    when point is within hidden text.

* kotl/kvspec.el (kvspec:initialize): Updated to use unless.
                 (kvspec:lines-to-show): Fixed to not alter which cells
  are visible; this in turn fixed display in kotl-mode:top-cells.

* hui-select.el: Removed all calls to with-syntax-table since there is no
    one table that works for all modes.  Better to simply modify each mode
    as needed for selection.
    (hui-select-thing): Solved problem where punctuation would not select
a region, so the region would never grow.  Now selects the word after point.
    (hui-select-punctuation): Fixed to select properly.
    (hui-select-initialize): Made . a symbol constituent in html and web
      modes so can select a series of object references like parent.child.subchild.

2016-05-18  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-select.el (hui-select-markup-modes, hui-select-initialize): Added
    support for web-mode (multiple language mode for HTML buffers).  Also
    bound {C-c .} for moving between matching tags in web-mode.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-javascript-at-tag-p): Rewrote for much tighter matching.
                (smart-javascript-keywords): Added to ignore keywords as identifier matches.
  hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Added missing . after smart-javascript-at-tag-p test.

* hyperbole.el (smart-javascript): Added missing autoload.

* kotl/klink.el (klink:at-p): Conditionalized smart-c-include-regexp to
    match only when in a C-based major mode, avoiding false hits in
    hmtl-mode, for example.

* wrolo-menu.el (wrolo-menubar-menu):
  kotl/kmenu.el (kotl-menubar-menu):
  hui-menu.el (hui-menu-options):
  hinit.el (hyperb:init-menubar):
  hui-menu.el (hyperbole-menubar-menu): Fixed so current-menubar is not
    referenced under GNU Emacs and improved readability.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode-map): Added [backtab] (Shift-TAB) binding
    to promote a tree (used to only be M-TAB but many outliners use
    Shift-TAB.

* hyperbole.el (wconfig-ring-empty-p): Added missing autoload for this
    which is referenced in the Hyperbole menubar menu.

* hversion.el (hyperb:mouse-buttons): Changed so Windows default is 3
    mouse buttons as many mice now have 3 buttons or can emulate 3 buttons.

* hsite-ex.el (htz:local): Hyperbole now automatically sets the timezone
    under Windows; manual modifications are no longer necessary.  Added
    conditionalized (require 'htz) here.
  htz.el (htz:local): Modified for MS Windows which returns things like
    "Eastern Daylight Time", so abbreviate to the first letter of each
    word for matching to htz:world-timezones.

2016-05-17  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:collapse-tree, kotl-mode:expand-tree):
   Fixed to not expand hidden cell when given the all-flag.
                    (kotl-mode:hide-subtree): Fixed to handle when point
   is in a hidden part of the tree.
                    (kotl-mode:move-after, kotl-mode:move-before): Changed
   to leave point at the start of the root of the moved or copied text, so
   user can see and further manipulate this text.

* kotl/kview.el (kview:get-cells-status, kview:set-cells-status, kcell-view:lines-visible,
    kcell-view:next-invisible-p, kview:map-expanded-tree):
      Added these functions and used in kview:map-* functions to restore
      cell view status after manipulation.
                (kview:move):
  kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:fill-tree, kotl-mode:fill-cell): Rewrote to
      utilize above new functions and to greatly improve maintaining the
      same view when some cells are collapsed and invisible.

* kotl/kvspec.el (kvspec:show-lines-this-cell): Added and used.

* kotl/kview.el (kview:map-branch, kview:map-siblings, kview:map-tree):
    Added a second save-excursion to eliminate movement within the kview
    if the kview is not within the current buffer.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:fill-cell): Changed to call
    kcell-view:collapsed-p.
    (kotl-mode:fill-tree): Fixed bug that did not expand whole tree for filling.

* wconfig.el (wconfig-set-window-configuration): Added and used throughout
    to handle bad wconfig entries.

* hinit.el (hyperb:init-menubar): Fixed to add Hyperbole to the menubar
    after emacs initializations are run.

* kotl/kvspec.el (kvspec:show-lines-per-cell): Simplified to first show
    all lines in all cells.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:shrink-region, kotl-mode:valid-region-p,
    kotl-mode:maybe-shrink-region-p):
      Added these new functions and used the last one at the start of each
      kotl-mode editing command to trigger an error if the region spans more
      than one cell, e.g. after a mouse drag.
    (kotl-mode:indent-region): Called last above function.
    (kotl-mode:shrink-region-flag): Added with default value of nil.
       When enabled, automatically shrinks the region to within a single cell
       before edit commands.
    (delete-selection-pre-hook): Overrode this function from delsel.el to
       possibly auto-shrink the region.
    (kotl-mode:*): Added mode-specific support for delete-selection-mode from delsel library.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Glossary): Added entries for Tramp and remote pathname.

* kotl/kview.el (kview:create): Added (kview:is-p) test in case kview
    exists already.  This may eliminate a sporadic issue where a kview
    data structure becomes invalid.

* hui-mini.el (hyperbole):
  hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help): Removed (require 'hsite) since the
    hyperbole.el file now takes care of this.

    Rewrote to generalize and support Tramp.
    Moved all hpath:* functions and variables from here to hpath.el.
  hpath.el (hpath:enable-find-file-urls, hpath:disable-find-file-urls): Rewrote to use Tramp.

    Tramp library support and changed to return the symbol for the package to use.

* hib-doc-id.el: Updated documentation and removed site-specific code.

==============================================================================
V5.10 changes ^^^^:
==============================================================================

* hyperbole.el (hsite): Added code to automatically install hsite.el and
    to warn if hsite-ex.el is newer.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Glossary): Added InfoDock and the OO-Browser definitions.

* hyperbole.el: Moved complete hyperb:dir setup here from hversion.el.
    Moved Hyperbole initialization here from hsite-ex.el.  Changed so this
    file requires hsite rather than vice-versa, allowing for single file
    loading and initialization of Hyperbole, including adding it to the
    load-path.  Do not separately require or load hsite anymore.

2016-05-13  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

*  man/hyperbole.texi (Koutliner Keys):
   kotl/EXAMPLE.kotl:

    properly match label-type value.

* kotl/kview.el (kview:move): Ensured collapsed cells list is created
    before the cells are moved, since insert may not retain collapsed
    properties.
                (kcell-view:collapse):
  kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:collapse-tree): Fixed to leave first line of cell visible.

  hypb.el (hypb:user-name): Added and used.
  hinit.el (hyperb:user-email): Added this variable and used to set the
    creator and modifier fields in Koutline cells.
           (hyperb:init): Initialized hyperb:user-email.  Deleted `hyperb:host-domain' variable.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode): Added call to kotl-mode:show-all prior to
    any change of major mode in a koutline buffer.  Also, made more
    variables buffer-local.

* kotl/klabel.el (klabel-type:to-label-end): Changed all returned
    functions to first move to the beginning of the line to ignore any labels
    hidden within a collapsed tree.
                 (klabel:set): Replaced delete-backward-char call with delete-char.

2016-05-11  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

    function to handle invisible newlines.
    (kotl-mode): Set track-eol to t for better end-of-line vertical movement.

* hui.el (hui:link-possible-types): Moved link to outline match to 2nd
    lowest priority, so that a link to file or directory is the default.
    Deleted link to elisp possibility as it can embed long elisp functions in
    the button data file and possibly not parse them correctly.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:line-move): Accounted for
   temporary-goal-column potentially being a cons.
   (kotl-mode:previous-line, kotl-mode:next-line): Unified begin and end
   messages with emacs.

2016-05-10  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* kotl/kview.el (kview:move):
  kotl/kfill.el: (kfill:forward-line): Defined and used so can better
    control line movement.

* hypb.el (hypb:insert-region): Rewrote to handle all invisible text.
  hyperbole.el (outline-invisible-in-p): Added.
  hui-mouse.el (smart-outline-subtree-hidden-p):
  hypb.el (hypb:insert-region):
  kotl/kvspec.el (kvspec:show-lines-per-cell):
  kotl/kview.el (kcell-view:collapse, kcell-view:expand, kview:move, kcell-view:collapsed-p):
  kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:fill-tree, kotl-mode:collapse-tree, kotl-mode:expand-tree,
                     kotl-mode:hide-subtree, kotl-mode:show-all, kotl-mode:hide-tree,
                     kotl-mode:fill-cell): Rewrote to use only outline-*
    functions, e.g. changed subst-char-in-region call to outline-flag-region.
                    (kotl-mode): Added line-move-ignore-invisible true
    setting and call to add-to-invisibility-spec.
                    (kotl-mode:line-move): Changed to boolean test of
    selective-display rather than integet test.
                    (kotl-mode): Set selective-display to nil, as does outline-minor-mode.

    macro, defined in hyperbole.el

* kotl/kfile.el: Changed to always require kmenu since menubars exist on dumb terminals now.

* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Added support for xref item lists.  Action
    Key displays an xref file line or just a file containing an xref.
    Assist Key displays the same but leaves point in the listing buffer.

* hpath.el (hpath:find): Fixed to expand relative file names in Hyperbole
    buttons to absolute paths based on the source directory of the button,
    e.g. when referencing a global button from a buffer in a directory
    different than the source directory.

* wrolo-menu.el (wrolo): Added (require 'wrolo).
  wrolo.el (wrolo-mode): Removed (require 'wrolo-menu).  Reversed who
    requires whom for these two files.

    button priority so that files and pathnames don't trigger as implicit
    buttons.
               (smart-dired): Changed last line quit handler to skip
    marked deletions and just quit dired.  To execute marked deletions,
    press the Action Key on the first line of the buffer (the dired
    directory name).

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:overview): Respect the blank-line viewspec,
    so the user can control it.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Keyboard Keys):
  hui-mouse.el (smart-gnus-group, smart-gnus-group-assist): If
    `gnus-topic-mode' is active, and on a topic line, the topic is
     expanded or collapsed as needed.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Keyboard Keys):
  hui-mouse.el (action-key-default-function): Added comment about setting
    it to #'hyperbole to bring up the Hyperbole minibuffer menu.

* hui-mini.el (hui:menus):
  hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu):
  hypb.el (hypb:remove-lines, hypb:save-lines): Added and used in menus,
    so interactive prompts match menu names and mnemonics.

2016-05-04  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyperbole.el (show-all): Removed autoload.
  hui-mouse.el:
  wrolo-menu.el (wrolo-menu-common-body):
  hyperbole.el (outline-*): Added aliases to new outline-* functions for older
    emacs versions.
  wrolo.el: Called new outline-* functions.

* wrolo-menu.el:
  kotl/kmenu.el:
  hinit.el (hyperb:init-menubar): Eliminated hyperb:window-system test
    since menubars now work on dumb terminals.
           (hui-menu): Added missing require of this library.

* hyperbole.el (hkey-global-set-key): Added to save global key bindings
    which Hyperbole overrides.  Used in hkey-initialize.
  hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-set-key-list): Use hkey-global-set-key.

* Makefile (ps): Rewrote this target.

    Emacs versions.
                (smart-tags-noselect-function): Added this support function.


* hmouse-key.el (action-key-depress, assist-key-depress,
    assist-key-depress-emacs19, action-mouse-key-emacs19): Removed
    (require 'hsite) since autoloads handle this.
    (action-mouse-key-emacs19, assist-mouse-key-emacs19): Added apply call
       to remove extra list layer here, rather than later.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Key Bindings): Updated.
  hmouse-key.el (hmouse-shift-buttons): Renamed to hmouse-install since
   bindings are always on shift buttons now and rewrote.
  hyperbole.el (hkey-initialize):
* hmouse-reg.el (hmouse-get-bindings): Removed NEXTSTEP unshifted mouse
    key bindings, just use shifted ones on a 2-button mouse.  Also renamed
    to hmouse-get-unshifted-bindings.
                (hmouse-setup): Renamed to hmouse-unshifted-setup.
                (hmouse-unshifted-setup): Changed mouse key bindings so
    mouse-3 is never bound to the Assist Key; now it can be used for popup
    menus.  This binds only mouse-2 to the Action Key.
  hmouse-reg.el: Removed this file and merged into hmouse-sh.el.

2016-05-03  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* wconfig.el (ring): Used ring.el to provide frame-specific, named window
     configurations and frame-specific window configuration rings.
  man/hyperbole.texi (Window Configurations): Updated documentation.

* hversion.el (hyperb:window-sys-term):
  hui-em19-b.el (hproperty:color-list, hproperty:good-colors): Added check
    for a window-system of gtk.

* hinit.el (hyperb:init): Fixed installation of
    hkey-override-local-bindings when hyperbole.el has already been loaded.

          (hbut:comment): Don't add comments in messaging-related buffers
    even though they have comment syntax.

* hmail.el (hmail:composer): Changed default from mail-mode to
    message-mode, the newer setting for Emacs.

* h-skip-bytec.lsp (hmouse-set-point): Deleted this file and moved this
    function to hmouse-key.el since the issue that kept us from
    byte-compiling this function under X must be fixed by now.

* hui-mini.el (hui:menu-help): Prevented error message when window cannot
    be shrunk.
              (hyperbole): Updated documentation.

2016-05-02  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

    before vertical drags.
                (hmouse-goto-depress-prev-point): Added.
                (hmouse-kill-region):
                (hmouse-kill-and-yank-region):
                (hmouse-yank-region):  Moved point to one end of the region
    that hkey-value stores.
                (hmouse-drag-region-active, hmouse-drag-not-allowed,
                 hmouse-goto-region-point): Added to handle the case
    where a region is active prior to a Smart Key drag; trigger an error.
  man/hkey-help.txt:
  man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Mouse Keys): Updated doc with these changes.

2016-05-01  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* kotl/kmenu.el (kotl-menubar-menu): Add the menu before the OO-Browser
    menu, if on the menubar.

* hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-setup): Disabled kmacro-call-mouse-event which can
   create a global mouse key binding to [S-mouse-3] that conflicts with the
   Assist Mouse Key.

* hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu):
  man/hyperbole.texi (Creating Outlines):
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus):
  DEMO: Renamed the Hyperbole Koutliner menus so they all start with K for
    consistency.  So now with the mini-buffer menu, type 'k' rather than
    'o' to utilize the Koutliner.

* hui-mini.el (hui:menus): Find>GrepFiles
  hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu): Find/Grep-Files
  hypb.el (hypb:rgrep, hypb:rgrep-command): Added this command as an
    autoload and used in Hyperbole menus, replacing standard grep command
    for a much more effective grep.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-tags-find-p, smart-tags-display): Fixed bug that
    overrode value of non-nil tags-table-list, sometimes preventing the
    Smart Key from showing a tag definition.

* hypb.el (hypb:configuration): Now adds the (HyDebug) entries from the
     Messages* buffer when composing a message to bug-hyperbole.

* hargs.el (hargs:completion): Generalized buffer-name match to include
    package-specific completions like *Ido Completions*" or any buffer
    in completion-mode.

* hypb.el (hypb:window-list): Simplified to use window-list which should
    be consistent across emacs variants now.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help-show): Removed set-buffer call because the
    displayed buffer has already been selected. Don't use help-mode in
    buffers already set up with a quit-key to bury the buffer,
    e.g. minibuffer completions, as this will sometimes disable default
    left mouse key item selection.
  hpath.el (hpath:display-buffer, hpath:display-buffer)
           (hpath:display-buffer-other-frame): Changed to return selected
    window and updated doc.; this fixed a completions failure in hkey-help-show
    used in temp-buffer-show-hook.

* man/hkey-help.txt: Unified horizontal and vertical drag actions,
    regardless of drag direction (left or right; up or down).  Action Key
    splits the current window and Assist Key deletes it.
  man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Mouse Keys): Updated doc here too.
  hui-window.el (hmouse-split-window-horizontally): Renamed to hmouse-vertical-action-drag;
    removed window-min-width setting.
                (hmouse-split-window-vertically): Renamed to hmouse-horizontal-action-drag
    and used in horizontal drag action; removed window-min-height setting.
                (hmouse-vertical-assist-drag):
                (hmouse-horizontal-assist): Renamed to hmouse-horizontal-assist-drag.
		(hmouse-horizontal): Deleted.

==============================================================================

==============================================================================

2016-04-30  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help-show): Added call to hpath:display-buffer so
    buffer is shown according to user custom settings.

* hpath.el (hpath:display-buffer): Removed call to hpath:push-tag-mark.
    It may be interferring with region selection/manipulation via Smart
    Key drags.

2016-04-29  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hinit.el (hyperb:init): Prefer newer write-file-functions variable.
    Moved Hyperbole key bindings and local key override initialization
    here and made them run after the editor is fully initialized.

* hversion.el (hyperb:window-sys-term):
  hui-window.el (hmouse-split-window-horizontally, hmouse-split-window-vertically):
    Changed function prefix from 'sm-'.

    function to show the context and values from each Smart Key activation.

* hui-mouse.el (require 'hbut): Added so don't have to conditionalize (hbut:at-p) call.
               (hkey-alist): Simplified hbut:at-p predicate and stored it result
   for debugging purposes.  Removed separate call to hbut:label-p since hbut:at-p
   calls it.
* hyperbole.el (hkey-initialize): Added this function and moved all
    Hyperbole key bindings here.  Added it to after-init-hook so
    Hyperbole key bindings are added only after Emacs is initialized,
    allowing them to override defaults where necessary, notably with mouse
    keys.

* hmouse-drv.el (action-mouse-key, assist-mouse-key): Added clear of hkey-value.

* Makefile (dist): Removed copying of hkey-help.txt from $(data_dir_dist)
    into distribution since this might be an old copy.  Remove
    data_dir_dist variable since no longer used.

* hypb.el (hypb:configuration): Small text improvements.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Smart Keyboard Keys): Improved doc for unrecognized contexts.

* man/hkey-help.txt: Corrected that by default, an invalid context

  Makefile (TEXI2HTML): Changed to use standard makeinfo --html.
           (HTML_MANUALS): Removed.  Added html format of the manual to

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help): Added check of newer Emacs variable
    help-window-select.

* hypb.el (hypb:push-mark): Deleted this old definition as all current
    Emacs versions have push-mark now.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp-at-tag-p): Tighted match to ignore all
    punctuation matches such as, ***.

* hui-select.el (hui-select-goto-matching-delimiter):
  hyperbole.el ({C-c .}): Added this global binding to jump between the
    opening and closing delimiters of a delimited thing, e.g. a string.
    Also, works on matching markup tag pairs in HTML and SGML modes.

* hyperbole.el (hkey-global-set-key, *hkey-list*): Added to capture global
    Hyperbole key sequences for possible unsetting in local modes.
               (hkey-override-local-bindings): Unset local keys here.

* hmouse-sh.el (hmouse-get-bindings, hmouse-setup):
  hmouse-reg.el (hmouse-get-bindings, hmouse-setup): Trigger NEXTSTEP setup
    only when window-system is 'dps, not 'ns which Mac OS X uses too.
    Fixes issue with binding the Action Key to mouse-1 instead of mouse-2
    under Emacs on Mac OS X.

2016-04-28  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hypb.el (hypb:mouse-help-file): Renamed to hypb:hkey-help-file.

* hyperbole.el (hkey-init): Changed doc to lookup keybindings.

* hmouse-drv.el (help-window-point-marker): Added conditional definition
    of this help variable not provided in earlier Emacs versions but
    referenced in an Emacs 25 compiled version of `with-help-buffer' used
    in `hkey-help-show'.  Fixes error with display of completions.
                (hkey-help-show): Nullified `temp-buffer-show-hook'
    and `temp-buffer-show-function' in here to prevent recursive call of
    help-mode when it calls with-temp-buffer.  This fixed error in display
    of apropos and other help information.
                (action-key, assist-key): Updated documentation.

* hyperbole.el (after-load-alist): Fixed quoting for this hook.

2016-04-27  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* h-skip-bytec.lsp (hmouse-set-point): Fixed to handle when called with no
    args from hkey-operate (keyboard drag emulation).

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-operate): Made prefix arg flag optional.

* HY-ABOUT: Added Hyperbole version number.

    and changed some descriptions of the bindings.

* hactypes.el (link-to-elisp-doc): Added support for variables.
  hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Added support for Emacs push buttons.  Action
    key activates a button at point and Assist Key shows help for it.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp-at-known-identifier-p, smart-tags-find-p): Added
    for testing whether a potential Lisp identifier is found in any tags file.

* hibtypes.el (texinfo-ref): Added support to display Texinfo nodes
    references within Texinfo node names and menu items.  Also to show
    documentation for Emacs Lisp identifiers within @code{} and @var()
    references.
  hmouse-tag.el (smart-emacs-lisp-mode-p): Since code references are
    handled within texinfo-ref now, removed texinfo-mode from matching here.
  man/hyperbole.texi (Implicit Buttons):
  man/hkey-help.txt: Updated doc with these changes.

* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist):
  hmouse-tag.el (smart-emacs-lisp-mode-p): Moved test for help-mode to here from hkey-alist.

2016-04-26  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hpath.el (hpath:is-p): Tightened match for in-file HTML references to
    avoid matching to Lisp #'function constructs.

* hui-mouse.el:
  hmouse-drv.el (hkey-region): Moved definition from hui-mouse.el where it wasn't referenced.

2016-04-25  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

                (hmouse-paste-region): Deleted and replaced with hmouse-yank-region.

* hui-window.el (hmouse-yank-region):
  hui.el (hui:buf-writable-err):

                (hmouse-kill-region):
                (hmouse-kill-and-yank-region):
	        (smart-point-of-coords):
                (hmouse-yank-region): Added to kill and yank delimited things via Smart Key drags.
                (hmouse-insert-region): Added to handle regional yanks.

  hmouse-reg.el: (hmouse-setup): Added drag event bindings for Emacs to
    support Hyperbole drag actions.
                 (hmouse-set-key-list): Added and used to simplify key bindings.

2016-04-22  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmail.el (hmail:invoke): Simplified by using compose-mail.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-tags-display): Prefer call to find-tag-noselect
    (newer etags.el) than find-tag-internal.

* man/hyperbole.texi:
  hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu): Renamed Customization menu to Customize.

* hyperbole.el (hmouse-shift-buttons): Bind Hyperbole mouse buttons only
      when hkey-init is true (the default).
     Removed compatibility functions for many years old emacs versions:
       frame function aliases,
       find-file-noselect overload and hyperb:find-file-noselect.
       (substitute-in-file-name): Made string-match tighter.
       (hkey-read-only-bindings): Removed local assist-key bindings which
     just shadow the same existing global binding, now that we can
     automatically eliminate local bindings that shadow the global
     Hyperbole Smart Keys.  Also simplified function.
     Removed PIEmail pm-hook; this package no longer exists.
       (assist-key-read-only): Removed, no longer used.
       (hkey-init): Made this an autoload.  Changed so no keys are bound herein
     unless this is true (previously, this affected only the Smart
     Keys). Reordered key bindings to emphasize Smart Keys.

* hyperbole (hkey-override-local-bindings, hkey-install-override-local-bindings,
     hkey-toggle-override-local-bindings):
     (hkey-init-override-local-keys): Added this new feature which allows for
     automatic removal of local key bindings that hide the Action Key.
     Set `hkey-init-override-local-keys' to nil to disable this feature.
  hui-menu.el (hui-menu-options): Added Toggle-Override-Local-Keys.
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus): Simplified Toggle-Rolo-Dates and added Override-Local-Key.

* hui.el (hui:hbut-help): Fixed bug where :help was bound as a symbol but
    not a function to be called.  Now ensures any type-specific help
    symbol is a function to call.
         (ebut:list): Called apply on set:create to fix list nesting bug.
         (hbut:report): Called with-help-window and nullified
   temp-buffer-show-{hook,function} to prevent a nested call to
   with-output-to-temp-buf that would erase the help buffer after data.

2016-04-21  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-lisp): Simplified documentation.

* hui-mouse.el (smart-man-c-routine-ref): Improved and fixed documentation.

* hmouse-tag.el (smart-tags-display): Small improvements.
    (smart-tags-file-path):
    (smart-c, smart-ancestor-tag-files): Changed 'tags-file-list' to newer
      'tags-table-list'.
    (smart-tags-display): Modified since emacs now uses 'tags-table-list'.
    (smart-tags-file-list): Improved tests.

* hibtypes.el (text-toc): Fixed to match documentation.

* hyperbole.el (vm-mode-hook): Renamed to this newer name.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Menus):
  hui.el (hui:bind-key): Added.
  hui-menu.el (hui-menu-options): Added Change-Key-Bindings menu and made
    Customization option settings into submenus as the single-level menu was
    getting too long.
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus): Added new Cust/KeyBindings menu that allows
    interactive rebinding of each global Hyperbole key.

* hgnus.el: (require 'gnus-msg): Added and removed old gnuspost.el loading.

* hargs.el (hargs:set-string-to-complete): Fixed bug that included
    minibuffer prompt in string; changed 'buffer-string' call to
    'minibuffer-contents'.

* hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu): Added Hyperbole Demonstration to
    the top-level menubar so it is easy for new users to find.

* hhist.el (all): Greatly improved to use frame configurations rather than just
    storing a point in a buffer.
 (hhist:wind-line): Deleted, unused.

* DEMO (By Dragging): Info node was improperly referenced with earlier name, 'Drags'.
    Made a number of small updates in this file.

* hypb.el (hypb:hyperbole-banner-keymap):
          (hypb:display-file-with-logo): Reworked to allow graphic in hyperb:dir.
    Refactored to support GNU Emacs.  Use 'help-mode' as major mode for
    easier navigaton and window restore.

* hpath.el (hpath:url-regexp2): Made : optional again so www.gnu.org works
    as a URL.

* Makefile (distclean): Remove any TODO* working files from the dist.
    Other small changes.

2016-04-20  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* kotl/klink.el (klink:create): Added save-excursion to prevent movement
    of point while reading arguments.

* hargs.el (hargs:select-p): Fixed code for newer Emacs versions.

* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist): Added kotl-mode-specific end-of-line predicate.

* wrolo-menu.el (wrolo-menubar-menu, id-popup-wrolo-menu, id-menubar-wrolo):
    Renamed these menus from Wrolo to Rolo.

* kotl/kmenu.el (id-menubar-kotl): Added 'Remove-this-Menu' item.
                (kotl-popup-menu):
  wrolo-menu.el (wrolo-popup-menu): Removed call to popup-menu-internal since GNU
       Emacs has popup-menu now.

* kotl/kmenu.el (kotl-menu-remove): Added.
  hui-menu.el (hui-menu-options):
  kotl/kmenu.el (kotl-menubar-menu):
  hui-menu.el (hui-menu-remove, hyperbole-menubar-menu): Fixed to work
    properly with Emacs menubars.
              (hui-menu-remove): Remove Koutline menu as well.

* Makefile: Added the following files as distribution dependency checks:
      auto-autoloads.el, DEMO, MANIFEST, _hypb, .hypb, _pkg.el,
      ChangeLog (only the latest one), hyperbole-banner.png, hypb-mouse.txt,
      file-newer, smart-clib-sym
    Changed distribution so only recent year ChangeLog is included, as the
    rest is very old and irrelevant now.

* hmouse-drv.el (hkey-help-show): Use help-mode major mode for Hyperbole Help buffers.
   This generally allows typing q to quit and restore the prior window configuration.

* man/hyperbole.texi (Menus): Added new Find menu documentation.
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus): Added new Find menu to find matches and
    non-matches of regexps across buffers and files.
    Removed HypbCopy item which duplicated Info item.
       Removed MsgForums since this manual section is gone and spread elsewhere.
  hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu): Added new Find menu to find matches and
    non-matches of regexps across buffers and files.
    Removed Copyright which duplicated Manual entry.  Removed Msg-Forums
    since this manual section is gone and spread elsewhere.

==============================================================================

==============================================================================

2016-04-19  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* MANIFEST:
  Makefile (EL_KOTL, ELC_KOTL): Added "kexport" file which had been
    mistakenly left out of distribution build dependencies.

2016-04-18  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode-map):
  kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:scroll-down, kotl-mode:scroll-up): Modified
    to work as global key bindings for use with mouse wheel scroll variables.

* hmail.el (hmail:invoke): Modernized to use mail-user-agent settings.

* hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu):
  hui-mini.el (hui:menus):
  hibtypes.el (hyp-address):
  hactypes.el (hyp-request): Updated mail list information and extended menus.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:maintain-region-highlight): Removed
    window-system conditional for transient-mark-mode since it now works on
    dumb terminals.

* kotl/kfile.el (kfile:view): Added missing file-name parameter to second
    'error' call.

* kotl/kfile.el (kfile:find-file-hook):
  kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:find-file-hook): Renamed to
    kfile:find-file-hook and moved to "kfile.el" to ensure that kfile is
    loaded (which loads kotl-mode) if this is invoked at startup, e.g. when
    desktop restores a file.  Left an alias to kotl-mode-find-file-hook
    for backward compatibility.

* Removed support for old, no longer used Apollo window system.

* hpath.el (hpath:display-buffer-alist, hpath:display-where-alist): Hash
    quoted functions for byte-compilation.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:add-indent-to-region): Rewrote with 'replace-match' call.

* MANIFEST: Corrected to reference kotl/EXAMPLE.kotl

* kotl/kfile.el:
  kotl/kotl.el: Improved naming: renamed this file to kcell.el to better represent it and
   renamed the 'kotl-data' structure to 'kcell-data'.

* hargs.el (hargs:iform-read): Added support for Emacs interactive '^'
   prefix character for activating/deactivating the transient region via
   shift selection.

* hpath.el (hpath:rfc): Updated to use ietf.org.

          (hact): Simplified.

2016-04-17  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode-map): Overloaded left-char and right-char for
  Emacs arrow keys.

* kotl/kexport.el (kexport:html): Replaced 'insert-string' with 'princ' since it works
    differently in GNU Emacs and would fail to export cell contents.
    (kexport:html): Updated doc string and added optional prefix arg,
    SOFT-NEWLINES-P to prevent hard newline breaks within cells.

* kotl/kotl-mode.el (kotl-mode:example): Rewrote so always uses the
    distribution EXAMPLE.kotl file rather than the personally saved and
    edited one, if the distribution file is newer.  In that case,
    save a copy of the personal one, as SAVED-EXAMPLE.kotl before replacing it.
    (kotl-mode:backward-or-forward-delete-char): Added GNU Emacs support.
    (kotl-mode-map): Added delete-forward-char.
    (kotl-mode:delete-char): Improved beginning and end of cell testing,
    fixing issues when prefix arguments are given.

* hvm.el: VM is not available as a regular Emacs package, so it is somewhat
    difficult to install properly.  Requiring it below will therefore
    often trigger an error and prevent Hyperbole from properly
    building, so prevent this error with a condition-case around this
    whole file.

* man/hyperbole.texi: Updated version, copyrights, URL handling documentation.

* hsys-w3.el (www-url): Changed to use browse-url.el support of textual
    browsers when not running under a window system.  Removed w3 library
    dependencies.

* hui-ep-but.el, hui-epV4-b.el: Deleted, Epoch is long obsolete.

* HY-README: Updated How to Obtain.

2016-04-16  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* HY-COPY: Updated to GPL V3.

* HY-ABOUT: Updated the intro.

* hui-mini.el (hui:menus):
  hui-menu.el (hui-menu-url-options): Modernized these menus for current
    web browsers and changed 'browse-url-new-window-p' to 'browse-url-new-window-flag'.
    Added toggle of 'browse-url-in-window-flag' menu item.

* Makefile (data_dir): Updated to reference hyperbole-banner.png image.

* hypb.el (hypb:browse-home-page): Renamed and changed to point to GNU Hyperbole web page.
	  (hypb:display-file-with-logo): Rewrote to do nothing if banner file is not found.

2016-04-14  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>
* hpath.el (hpath:find-line): Replaced goto-line call since it is meant for interactive use.

* hbut.el (htype:create, ibtype:create):
  hargs.el (hargs:make-iform-vector):
  hui-em19-b.el (hproperty:list-cycle):
  hui-xe-but.el (hproperty:list-cycle):
  hpath.el (hpath:display-alist): Changed from defmacro to defsubst or updated macro syntax.

* hui-menu.el (hui-menu-options): Removed old-style backquoting.

* set.el (set:remove): Fixed bug by removing extra set of parentheses around args in call to 'set:member'.

* hui-menu.el (infodock-hyperbole-menu): Conditionalized "%_" XEmacs menu
    accelerator key prefix, so it does not appear as a literal in the Hyperbole menu name under GNU Emacs.

2016-04-05  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* set.el (set:create): Improved to allow collection types as set elements.

* set.el (set:difference): Fixed boundary case error by adding (setq rtn-set ...)
    Also, updated defmacro syntax, used self-quoting lambdas and changed many mapcar calls to mapc.

2016-03-29  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hyperbole.el ("info"): Simplified with eval-after-load

	`backward-char-command' and `forward-char-command' for overloading.

2014-08-16  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

* hui-mouse.el (hkey-alist):
  hmouse-tag.el: Added support for JavaScript identifier definition location.

2014-08-28  Bob Weiner  <rsw@gnu.org>

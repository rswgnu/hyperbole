* Introduction

  Welcome to GNU Hyperbole.  Hyperbole will super-charge your GNU Emacs
  experience, allowing you to work faster, utilize fewer key bindings, recall
  more information and link it all together by learning just a few concepts
  and keys.  Invest an hour learning Hyperbole now and speed your daily
  information management for years to come.

  If you simply want to know what Hyperbole is, see the file "HY-ABOUT".
  Hyperbole displays that file when you press {C-h h d a}.  Hyperbole assumes
  you know how to use Emacs.  Otherwise, run the Emacs tutorial by pressing
  {C-h t} first.

  You should be looking at this file within Emacs and Hyperbole should
  already be installed within your copy of Emacs.  To be sure, press 'C-h h'
  and you should see the Hyperbole menu in your minibuffer window at the
  bottom of your current Emacs frame.  Press 'q' to quit out of this menu and
  we can begin.  If Hyperbole is not installed, see the "INSTALL" file, in
  the same directory as this file, for instructions on installing it.


* Implicit Buttons

  Hyperbole automatically recognizes many common and complex patterns within
  Emacs buffers and turns them into hyperbuttons that either link to other
  things or perform a set of actions.  No need for markup, simply press on a
  button in any kind of Emacs buffer to activate it.

  These patterns are called `implicit buttons' and are activated by pressing
  {M-RET} (ESC RETURN, ALT-RETURN, or CMD-RETURN) or SHIFT-MIDDLE-MOUSE
  anywhere within them (this is known as the Action Key).  Hyperbole
  recognizes these buttons using its predefined implicit button types that
  specify how to recognize each type of button and what action it performs.
  (For example, the web links in the table above are implicit buttons that
  display web pages).  You can also add your own button and action types.

  Try pressing {M-RET} or SHIFT-MIDDLE-MOUSE on some of the implicit buttons
  in double quotes below to activate them and see how they behave.  Press
  {C-h A} (the A must be capitalized) on any Hyperbole button to see exactly
  what it does prior to activating it.


* Pathname Implicit Buttons

    "HY-NEWS#ORG MODE:2:6"   - outline section anchor & relative line number

       Display the file, "HY-NEWS", go to the star-outline section 'ORG
       MODE', move 2 lines into that section and then move 6 characters
       forward.

       Existing files and pathnames are recognized without double quotes as
       well.

       The variable, <hpath:display-where>, determines where Hyperbole
       displays all button referents, whether in another window or frame.

    "#Key Series Implicit Buttons"

       Display at the top of another window the named section from the
       current buffer.

    <[comp]>: "README.md#Hyperbole Components" - Markdown anchor with spaces intact

       Display the file, "README.md", scrolled to it outline section,
       "Hyperbole Components".  Name this button, 'comp'.  Then you can link
       to it elsewhere in the buffer with <ilink: comp>.  {M-RET} on the
       ilink to activates the button it links to.

    "${hyperb:dir}/HY-NEWS"          - Elisp or environment variables; $VAR
                                       shell vars work too


    "subr.el"                        - edit any Elisp library in load-path

       The variable, hpath:auto-variable-alist, determines which file
       suffixes are looked up using variables containing multiple search
       directories. By default, Org files, Python files and Elisp files are
       handled.

    "(hyperbole)action-key-modeline-function" 

       Double quoted Info manual references are also implicit buttons.  You
       can link to both nodes/sections in GNU Info manuals as well as to
       specific lines referenced by an index entry, as shown above, providing
       fine-grained structured document linking.  Remember this as there will
       be more Info links below.


* Key Series Implicit Buttons

    A key series is an arbitrary length set of Emacs keystrokes surrounded by
    braces, like a visual keyboard macro.  RET, SPC and ESC are translated
    into their respective keys.  Activate them with {M-RET} or
    SHIFT-MIDDLE-MOUSE.

    {C-h A}

       Press {C-h A} when over any Hyperbole button for an explanation of
       what it does.

    {M-x dired-other-window RET ${hyperb:dir}/*.el RET}

       Hyperbole home directory Dired listing of Emacs Lisp files only

    {C-c @ 22 RET}

       Display a 2x2 windows grid in the current frame of the 4 most recently
       used buffers.  Before you try this, remember the binding {C-h h h} for
       History.  Use that to return to your current window configuration
       after pressing the Action Key on any windows grid button.

    {C--1 C-c @ kotl/kotl-*.el RET}

       Find the Hyperbole Koutliner source files that begin with 'kotl' and
       display them in an auto-sized grid of windows.

    {C-u 0 C-c @ emacs-lisp-mode RET 33 RET}

       Display the 9 mostly recently used Emacs Lisp buffers in a 3x3 grid.
       A BLANK buffer fills in the grid if there are not enough Emacs Lisp
       ones.

    {C-x 4 d ${hyperb:dir} RET}

       Dired the Hyperbole home directory based on its variable.

       Within this dired buffer, mark a few files with {m} and then press {@}
       to display a window grid of those files only.  That works in Buffer
       Menu and IBuffer modes as well.

    {C-x C-b C-x C-q M-x keep-lines RET .el$ RET C-x C-q}

       Display a buffer list of Emacs Lisp file buffers only

    {C-x C-b C-x C-q M-x keep-lines RET [\\/]$ RET C-x C-q}

       Buffer list of directory buffers only


* Posix/Linux Shell Command Implicit Buttons

    Some of the below commands require recursive use of the minibuffer, so let's
    ensure that is enabled:

    <setq enable-recursive-minibuffers t>

    The shell command part of the demo requires a shell that is compatible
    with bash.  If you are using another shell you can switch to bash for
    this part of the demo:

    { M-x set-variable RET shell-file-name RET C-u M-! /usr/bin/env SPC bash RET RET }

       Set the name of the inferior shell to /bin/bash. If you do this
       don't forget to reset it to your preferred shell when you are ready
       with the demo.

    { M-x shell RET M-> (cd ${hyperb:dir}) RET }

       Move to a directory in a shell based on a Lisp variable.  Sections
       within key series surrounded by parentheses maintain spaces between
       words without the need to use 'SPC'.

    {M-x shell RET M-> (export HYPERBOLE_DIR=${hyperb:dir} && 
     cd $HYPERBOLE_DIR && grep -n gbut:label-list *.el) RET}

       Use both a Hyperbole resolved variable, ${hyperb:dir}, and a
       shell-resolved environment variable, $HYPERBOLE_DIR, to grep through
       Lisp files.

    {M-x shell RET M-> (apropos grep) RET}

       Use Posix apropos command to list grep-related commands.  Then press
       {M-RET} on any lines output to display the man page for the associated
       command.


* Grep Messages, Stack Traces, Man Page Apropos Implicit Buttons

  These implicit buttons typically appear in shell buffers.  You issue a
  shell command and then use {M-RET} or SHIFT-MIDDLE-MOUSE on the output
  lines of the command to display the associated reference.

** grep -n gbut:label-list *.el
hactypes.el:454:					      (mapcar #'list (gbut:label-list))
hbut.el:605:				       (mapcar #'list (gbut:label-list))

       An Action Key press anywhere on the text of the two above output lines
       from a grep -n or a ripgrep command jumps to the referenced line.

** python topwin.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "topwin.py", line 18, in <module>
    import Quartz

       An Action Key press anywhere on the above 2 non-blank lines jumps to
       the source of the error.  You can jump into any stack frame this way
       when debugging from pretty much any language, even in a regular shell.

** man -k spell
aspell(1)                - interactive spell checker
aspell-import(1)         - import old personal dictionaries into GNU Aspell
pspell-config(1)         - prints information about a libpspell installation

       An Action Key press anywhere on the above 3 non-blank lines displays
       the associated man documentation page.


* Action Buttons (generalized form of implicit buttons)

  If you know your way around Emacs Lisp and want to quickly turn snippets of
  Lisp code or Lisp variables into Hyperbole buttons, just remove any outer
  parentheses and surround the remaining code with <angle-brackets>.

  Here are some examples.

    <shell>

       Jump to an existing shell buffer or create a new one.

    <fill-column>

       Display the variable value of 'fill-column' in the minibuffer

    <find-file-other-window (expand-file-name "DEMO" hyperb:dir)>
    <hpath:find "${hyperb:dir}/DEMO")>
    "${hyperb:dir}/DEMO"

       All three of the above do essentially the same thing, displaying the
       file.

    <kotl/EXAMPLE.kotl, 3b10 |c2en>

       Display a Hyperbole Koutline starting from cell 3b10 with lines per
       cell clipped to 2.


* Many More Implicit Button Types to Learn Across Time

  Activate this button, <emacs-lisp-mode>, to set this buffer into Emacs Lisp
  mode.  Then an Action Key press on each of the implicit button types below
  will jump to its Lisp definition.  Use this if you want to see what each
  type can do.  <normal-mode> reverts to the standard mode.

|---------------------------------------------------------------------------|

Implicit button types are stored in their own namespace, 'ibtypes::', so to
see the doc on the 'pathname' ibtype, use {C-h f ibtypes::pathname RET}.  To
learn how to create new kinds of implicit button and action types, see:
"(hyperbole)Creating Types".


* Hyperbole Explicit and Global Buttons

  You have learned the basics of Hyperbole implicit button types.  Hyperbole
  has two other categories of buttons:

    `Explicit buttons' are manually created and embedded within buffers and
    explicitly assigned any of many action types that Hyperbole includes.
    These contrast with implicit buttons which Hyperbole generates
    automatically by recognizing text patterns in buffers.  Explicit buttons
    look like this: <(fake button)>.  They are quickly recognizable, yet
    relatively non-distracting as one scans the text in which they are
    embedded.  Explicit buttons can link to local and remote files or to a
    section within a document; they can calculate things or query databases
    or show different views of bodies of information.  Unlike HTML
    hyperbuttons, there is no markup language to learn nor specific document
    format required.  You can create explicit buttons with simple keyboard
    presses or mouse drags from one window to another; See the {C-h h e} menu
    for explicit button commands.  See "DEMO#Explicit Buttons" or
    "(hyperbole)Explicit Buttons" for more detail.

    `Global buttons' are labeled Hyperbole buttons in your personal button
    file, {C-h h b p}.  All global buttons are activated by name with
    completion provided, independent of which buffers are on-screen, {C-h h g
    a}.  Global buttons may be <(explicit buttons)> or <[labeled/named]>
    implicit buttons in the personal button file.  See the {C-h h g} menu for
    global button commands.  See "DEMO#Global Buttons" or "(hyperbole)Global
    Buttons" for more detail.


* Hyperbole Subsystems

  Hyperbole includes a number of subsystems that can raise your productivity
  when looking up any kind of hierarchical records (including those from Org
  mode or Outline mode), managing the precise location of windows and frames,
  and one of the most advanced legal outliners available anywhere.

** HyRolo

  HyRolo is an advanced hierarchical, record-oriented retrieval system that
  uses text files for storing its records.  Most often this is used for
  contact management but it can quickly be adapted to most any
  record-oriented lookup task requiring fast retrieval.  Press {M-RET} on
  "(hyperbole)HyRolo".

** HyControl

  Hyperbole includes the fastest, easiest-to-use Emacs window and frame
  management system available, HyControl, found under the Hyperbole Screen
  menu, {C-h h s}.  If you use a lot of Emacs windows or frames (native
  window system windows), then this tool is for you.  Press {M-RET} on
  "(hyperbole)HyControl".

** Koutliner

  The Hyperbole Koutliner produces multi-level, autonumbered hierarchies of
  cells.  Each cell has two identifiers, a relative autonumber indicating its
  present position within the outline and a permanent identifier suitable for
  use within hyperlink references to the cell.

  A demonstration of the Koutliner is found on the Hyperbole Kotl/Example
  menu entry.  {C-h h k e}, gives you an editable copy of Hyperbole's example
  Koutliner file.  This explains the Koutliner commands and lets you try them
  out as you learn.  Additional documentation can be found in
  "(hyperbole)Koutliner".  "(hyperbole)Koutliner Keys" summarizes, in
  alphabetical order, the Koutliner commands which are bound to keys.


* Reference Documentation

  As noted at the start, "DEMO" provides a more extensive, interactive look
  into Hyperbole.

  For those who want the deepest knowledge of Hyperbole, there is the long
  Hyperbole reference manual that you can read in sections.  This covers in
  detail how each button and action type works, how to create your own button
  and action types and much more.  See "(hyperbole)" or use {C-h h d i}.

  It is included in the "${hyperb:dir}/man/" subdirectory of Hyperbole in
  four forms:

    "man/hyperbole.info"   - online Info browser version
    "man/hyperbole.html"   - web HTML version
    "man/hyperbole.pdf"    - printable version
    "man/hyperbole.texi"   - source form
